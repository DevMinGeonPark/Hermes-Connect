# Hermes-Relay — TODO

Open items that don't fit a formal Phase plan but shouldn't be lost. Items move from here into a Plan in `docs/spec.md` or an Obsidian Phase plan once they're ready to schedule.

## Complete native UI device certification

Verify the refreshed Chat/profile/navigation and split Voice Focus on a physical
Fold8: outer/inner display transitions, hinge posture, keyboard, TalkBack,
200% text, and returning to an unsent draft. Width-based Compose renders and
an API 36 emulator do not certify the physical hinge or OEM lifecycle behavior.

## Repair five existing Android unit-test failures

The native UI audit reproduced five failures on the unchanged `f642597a` base:
`ChatViewModelGatewayInboundTurnTest` has three profile display-name expectation
failures (`explicitDefaultDraftUsesLiteralDefaultProfile`,
`allProfilesSwitchBetweenDifferentOwnersReplacesVisibleIdentity`,
`allProfilesOpenScopesHistoryResumeAndSendToSelectedOwner`).
`VoiceViewModelBargeInTest`'s interaction-mode capture-release case and
`VoiceViewModelRealtimeSessionFenceTest.queuedCancelDismissesWhenAcknowledgementNeverArrives`
hit a null XML parser while resolving Android resources. Reconcile the former
with current display-name rules and give the latter a resource-capable test
environment. These are outside the native presentation change; the focused
pre-push shard remains the required local gate.

## Restore the plugin manifest v2 declaration after the Hermes installer fix ships

Hermes installers in affected stable releases reject `manifest_version: 2`
before the v2-capable runtime loader can inspect the plugin. Track upstream
[PR #85893](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/85893). Restore
`plugin/plugin.yaml` to `manifest_version: 2` only after that fix ships in a
stable Hermes release that Hermes-Relay can treat as its minimum supported
version. Until then, keep the v1 compatibility declaration and the additive
metadata consumed by newer hosts.

---

## Consider hosted Android emulator execution

The local API 36 Gradle Managed Device lanes are intentionally on demand and
individually selected. The current Android On-Demand workflow covers hosted
source, unit, lint, and build verification only; it does not run emulators. If
local emulator capacity becomes a recurring constraint, evaluate a separately
approved hosted-emulator design with explicit cost, concurrency, artifact
retention, and trigger policy. Do not schedule the full form-factor matrix or
add a device farm until that policy is approved; keep live-server mutation tests
outside any automatic matrix.

---

## Upstream a public Dashboard plugin WebSocket admission seam

The same-origin Relay ingress follows current upstream's bundled Dashboard
plugin pattern but must feature-detect private
`hermes_cli.web_server._ws_request_is_allowed` and `_ws_auth_ok` helpers.
Propose one public helper that combines Host/Origin policy, single-use ticket
authentication, and runtime plugin-enabled gating for `APIRouter` WebSockets.
After it is available in the supported Hermes baseline, replace the private
imports and remove the Relay plugin's local runtime-disable polling. Until
then, missing helpers fail closed and direct Relay remains an advanced
compatibility route.

---

## Upstream an Android Gateway platform hint

Android currently identifies its standard Gateway sessions with the legacy
`webui` source because upstream has no stable Android/mobile session platform.
Current upstream deliberately removed the unused `webui` prompt hint and only
ships renderer-verified `desktop` and `tui` guidance. Do not relabel Android as
Desktop: that would also advertise Desktop-only inline widgets and directives.
Propose an upstream Android/mobile platform hint, or a bounded authenticated
client-surface context contract, that accurately describes mobile Markdown,
standard upstream media/file delivery, and concise-response expectations. Once
that contract is available in the supported Hermes baseline, adopt it and add
Gateway conformance coverage proving the exact prompt bytes and session source.

Issues [#556](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/issues/556) and
[#557](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/issues/557) share this contract
gap. The Android audit fix labels unsupported context; automatic Android
identification and Gateway phone-status delivery still require upstream work.
Rechecked against upstream `5dea46d13deec9549bdc2ea703ae9201d733c28d`:

- [`methods_prompt.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/5dea46d13deec9549bdc2ea703ae9201d733c28d/tui_gateway/methods_prompt.py)
  accepts `surface` only for `hud` and `voice-live`; it has no general
  per-turn system-context parameter. Neither surface means Android.
- [`session_notifications.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/5dea46d13deec9549bdc2ea703ae9201d733c28d/tui_gateway/session_notifications.py)
  adds those built-in surface notes to model input without changing the
  persisted user row. This is the existing upstream seam to extend, with
  explicit client capability negotiation, bounded opted-in context, and
  turn-owned snapshots through queueing, retries, and client switches.
- [`server.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/5dea46d13deec9549bdc2ea703ae9201d733c28d/tui_gateway/server.py)
  accepts a caller-supplied session `source`, but
  [`prompt_builder.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/5dea46d13deec9549bdc2ea703ae9201d733c28d/agent/prompt_builder.py)
  has no Android platform hint. A session-origin label is not verified
  current-turn sender identity. Do not invent a platform or use a client hint
  as authorization for phone tools.
- The API server's `POST /api/sessions` source field belongs to the explicit
  API-only surface. Android standard chat creates/resumes sessions through
  Gateway RPC; that REST field does not add per-turn context to `prompt.submit`.

Keep unknown/older hosts supported without sending private parameters,
rewriting the user transcript, overriding persona, or requiring Relay.

---

## Scope sensitive-media prompt guidance to capable clients

The Relay plugin's sensitive-media prompt section currently describes the
Android `||![...](...)||` and alt-text conventions profile-wide. Before
expanding that behavior, make the section depend on an authoritative client
capability or replace it with a portable convention verified against every
renderer that receives the profile prompt. Do not make Desktop/TUI sessions
emit Android-only spoiler syntax merely because the Relay plugin is installed.

---

## Certify Android session activity across lifecycle and profile boundaries

The contract fixture now covers every upstream live status, complete-snapshot
disappearance, client-side ownership of duplicate durable ids across profiles,
and older Gateways without `session.active_list`. Before calling the status
model device-certified:

- Exercise working, quiet tool-heavy work, each pending-input surface, normal
  completion, a lost terminal followed by an exact active-list Idle row, Stop,
  reconnect, app restart, and process recreation against current vanilla
  upstream. Confirm the lost-terminal path preserves the partial transcript,
  settles composer/steering state, and drains or cancels queued corrections
  exactly once according to the owning turn outcome.
- Verify All Profiles with duplicate session ids across two profiles and two
  saved connections; no late snapshot or old socket generation may mark the
  wrong row live.
- Confirm failed/unsupported refresh becomes Unavailable, restart revalidation
  remains Checking, ambiguous or partially
  resolved process-wide snapshots infer no absence, a complete empty snapshot
  settles every unambiguously owned scope, and REST `is_active=true` never
  renders as Working.
- Run a background process that outlives its parent turn and verify Background
  work remains separate from the conversation's Idle state.
- On a physical phone, open and repeatedly foreground Android while the same
  session is working in official Desktop/TUI; verify Android sends no live
  attach/interrupt RPC, the producer completes, and final history appears.
- Pursue an upstream `session.active_list` profile field/filter or an aggregate
  activity route with explicit profile ownership so multi-profile clients do
  not need to resolve process-wide rows from durable keys.

---

## Bot Mode follow-ups after multi-gateway aggregation

Android Bot Mode now has an all-gateway roster, typed `(connectionId, profile)`
ownership, install-identity collapse, source-qualified handles, offline cache,
route-pooled Gateway clients, and dedicated owner-routed Bot Chats without a
foreground connection switch. Keep autonomous cross-gateway delivery on
upstream peer/server authority rather than making Android an unreliable
background courier. Writable group rooms stay blocked until upstream publishes
one canonical room read/write/control contract; do not reproduce Desktop's
local orchestrator in the phone. Route-scoped outbound attachments, Relay media,
voice, and proactive completion notifications can be added independently when
their credential and lifecycle ownership is explicit.

---

## Certify Android assistant screen context on physical firmware

Host-side coverage and one Android 15 automotive device prove the primary flow.
Before claiming broad firmware compatibility:

- Certify representative phone OEMs, secure-window behavior, rotation, cancellation,
  process recreation, and callbacks that arrive before the session is shown.
- Confirm hidden/password exclusion, untrusted labeling, draft isolation, retry after
  attachment preflight failure, and exactly-once delivery across later voice turns.
- Verify Full Voice survives assistant-process loss and that wake-word, power-button,
  ordinary assistant, and keyguard paths never receive screen context.
- Exercise repeated explicit WEB_SEARCH launches and confirm the permission, active
  Assistant role, request coalescing, and single-session gates remain fail-closed.

---

## Reassess Play Console data safety for assistant screen context

Before the next Google Play submission, reassess the Console's User content and
data-sharing answers for optional Assistant voice, visible text, and screenshot
delivery to the user-configured Hermes server and AI provider. Record the final
answers in `docs/play-store-listing.md`.

---

## Certify Android Gateway missing-terminal recovery on physical devices

Deterministic fake-Gateway coverage now proves that a foreground turn with
rapid deltas and tool activity can lose its WebSocket before
`message.complete`, reactivate the exact live runtime, observe authoritative
`running=false`, and reconcile persisted history without navigation, API
fallback, duplicate submission, or a silent streaming latch. Complete the
remaining hardware matrix before treating issue #365 as device-certified:

On-demand contract-lab certification passed on an Android 16 SM-S938U using
the sideload app and instrumentation APK. The embedded device test exercised
Activity `STARTED` to `RESUMED` while streaming; the external fixture test then
proved prompt submission, controlled socket loss, exact activation,
authoritative HTTP history, idle settlement, and no API fallback. The ADB
runner separately completed launch, Home/foreground, force-stop, and process
recreation without enabling radio mutation. This is deterministic fixture
proof, not certification against the reporter's host/device or a live provider.

- Re-run long multi-turn/tool-heavy chats against current vanilla upstream on
  the originally reported Android/device family and one Android 14+ device.
- Exercise foreground-open chat, background/foreground, Wi-Fi/cellular loss,
  socket replacement, queued follow-ups, profile/session switches, and process
  recreation while capturing the content-free Gateway recovery diagnostic.
- Confirm selection, user-owned scrollback, streaming Markdown, and follow
  behavior remain stable while authoritative history catches up.

---

## Certify Android power fixes across the reported device matrix

Issue #377's static estimates are not device measurements. The code now keeps
the idle Sphere static, gates inactive waveform/drawer animation, detaches the
MediaProjection surface between requested frames, binds AEC/NS to the capture
session, releases unattended wake locks at command completion, and reuses the
wake-word normalization buffer. Complete the remaining physical proof before
assigning battery percentages or declaring the report closed:

- Re-run the reported Android 13 / Pixel 4 XL workload with screen-on and
  screen-off intervals separated, and with experimental wake listening both
  disabled and explicitly enabled. Capture scoped CPU/thread/network/wakelock
  evidence plus Battery Historian or Perfetto without resetting batterystats
  unless the device owner approves the reset.
- On Android 14+ and a foldable/rotation path, request two screenshots around a
  geometry change and verify the existing VirtualDisplay resizes, its surface
  is detached between requests, and the projection token is not reused.
- On at least one device with platform AEC, run Standard and Realtime barge-in
  through playback and confirm the effect is enabled on the AudioRecord session,
  the microphone remains single-owner, interruption still works, and teardown
  leaves no audio effect or capture session active.
- Compare Wi-Fi and cellular separately. Treat radio-tail claims as unproven
  until packet timing and mobile-radio active time reproduce them on hardware.

---

## Certify the official Desktop Relay plugin

The unified `plugin/desktop/plugin.js` implementation is covered by source-level
SDK contract, packaging, explicit-open, no-auto-open, close, unload, and profile
cache-isolation tests. A physical official Hermes Desktop session is still
required before calling the UX live-certified:

- Test default and named local profiles, ordinary authenticated remote mode,
  and SSH mode with differently named local/remote profile mapping.
- In two full app windows, prove enabling, registration, explicit open,
  requests, close/reopen, hot reload, and disable/unload remain window-local.
- Prove startup, reconnect, profile change, layout restore/reset, update, and
  background events never open or focus Relay.
- Drag and dock the pane across native zones, close it, reopen it from all three
  labeled actions, and verify no private-hook fallback is needed.
- Exercise Relay running/unreachable, zero/one/multiple devices, pairing,
  revocation, bridge activity, media, remote access, and renderer error logging
  without exposing credentials, pairing payloads, filesystem paths, or tokens.

---

## Structured desktop hardware capabilities

Structured access and per-host USB policy now ship with typed, serial-bound ADB
list, shell, push, pull, install, and bounded logcat operations. Remaining work:
- Add microphone and camera only with backend readiness detection, bounded local
  grants, active-use indicators, audit events, and immediate cancellation.
- Reconcile legacy `desktop_screenshot` with the task-granted computer screenshot
  path so screen capture follows one policy.
- Extend capability policy beyond hardware only where a typed broker provides a
  meaningfully stronger boundary than Structured mode already provides.

---

## Android Plugin Studio protocol follow-ups

The first live declarative Plugin lane is host-local: Relay tools create bounded
draft JSON, Android previews it through the authenticated Dashboard namespace,
and exact-digest Keep/Remove actions require an Android user tap. Complete the
multi-session protocol before treating `lifecycle=session` as an isolation claim:

- Derive draft ownership from trusted Hermes task context and store only an HMAC
  of that identifier; never accept a model-supplied session owner.
- Filter draft discovery by the Android app's active Hermes session while keeping
  profile and connection publications separate with explicit precedence.
- Replace foreground five-second catalog polling with authenticated catalog
  invalidation events plus ETag polling fallback.
- Expire abandoned drafts and pending approvals, and add revision-bound profile
  versus connection promotion targets.

---

## Split fast Android unit tests from resource and screenshot tests

The quick-loop commands now narrow execution to the sideload debug variant and
support one-class filtering, but all `:app` unit tests still share one Android
test variant. That variant includes merged Android resources, gives every test
worker a 2 GiB heap, runs on JDK 21, and enables Roborazzi recording because a
small subset of Robolectric/screenshot tests requires those settings.

Create a separate resource/screenshot test lane so pure state, parser, routing,
and formatting tests can run as ordinary JVM tests without Android resource
packaging. Keep golden-image recording explicit rather than applying it to all
unit tests, preserve a CI task that runs both lanes, and benchmark cold plus
warm focused-test latency before adopting the split.

---

## Verify Android native dashboard sign-in on device

Android now selects Custom Tab + PKCE for HTTPS gateways that advertise
`native_pkce`. The lifecycle-owned callback binds only `127.0.0.1` on an
OS-assigned port, keeps verifier/state inside the sign-in coroutine, rejects
untrusted callback noise, and closes on completion, cancellation, navigation,
or timeout. Encrypted bearer/refresh tokens authenticate Gateway chat, Manage,
prewarm, and standard voice; sign-out clears both cookie and native sessions.
Older gateways retain the identified WebView cookie fallback.

Before release, device-test the real Custom Tab → provider → loopback return,
configuration/background transitions, Manage reload, Gateway chat ticket,
standard voice, sign-out, and process relaunch. Native bearer exchange remains
disabled for non-loopback HTTP dashboard addresses; configure HTTPS before
using the native flow.

---

## Active — Remove temporary GitHub Pages docs redirects

PR #210 moved current source and production documentation to
`https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/`, but Android 1.4.0 and earlier releases still
contain hardcoded `https://codename-11.github.io/hermes-relay/` links. GitHub
Pages therefore serves a redirect-only compatibility shim from
`legacy-pages-redirect/`; it must never regain full documentation content.

Retire the shim only after the first Android release containing merge commit
`52df3adbf6d61d0ddbfb69671546f7c4953f956a` has been available for at least
90 days **and** at least two Android releases containing the corrected links
have shipped. If either condition is unmet at review time, retain it and set a
new review date.

Removal checklist:

- Remove `.github/workflows/legacy-docs-redirect.yml` and
  `legacy-pages-redirect/` through a reviewed PR.
- Delete/disable the repository Pages site after that PR merges.
- Verify `https://codename-11.github.io/hermes-relay/` no longer serves the
  shim and `https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/` plus representative deep links
  still return HTTP 200.
- Update `DEVLOG.md` and the canonical Obsidian Hermes-Relay project note.

A one-shot operator reminder is scheduled for **2026-10-15 at 09:00 ET** to
review these gates; it is a review trigger, not authorization for automatic
removal.

## Upstream impact certification follow-ups (2026-07-19)

The client/plugin implementation batch for queued recovery,
multiplex-profile fallback routing, gateway diagnostics, Windows system-CA
trust, and retained bootstrap async safety is implemented. The following gates
intentionally remain outside that code batch:

- **Image-generation lifecycle while tool progress is hidden.** The upstream
  TUI gateway suppresses every `tool.start` / `tool.complete` event when
  `display.tool_progress` is off, so a client cannot distinguish an active
  `image_generate` turn from generic model work. Propose a narrow upstream
  exception that always emits the lifecycle for `image_generate` while leaving
  unrelated tool diagnostics hidden. Android already treats that lifecycle as
  presentation state rather than a generic tool card and keeps the diffusion
  canvas visible when its local tool display is off.
- Run `docs/upstream-compatibility-certification.md` against an approved test
  gateway with real provider calls and an Android device. Include concurrent
  model/image routing, turn isolation off/on, queued reconnect, same-profile
  background-completion ownership, compression lineage, and the explicitly
  approved restart case. Static upstream fixtures are necessary but do not
  prove device or restart behavior.
- Upstream the atomic one-turn model arm/submit contract proposed in
  `docs/upstream-contributions.md`. Until then, document the narrow race where a
  disconnect or Stop after `/model --once` succeeds but before prompt submission
  can leave the override armed for a later prompt.
- Keep HRUI-052 (`/new` session-control reset parity) blocked until upstream
  exposes a reset on the active gateway session or an authoritative reset event.
  `slash.exec` runs the command in a separate worker today, and the mirrored
  slash side effects do not reset the active TUI session's agent. Relay must not
  clear local model, reasoning, or Fast pins from a successful command response
  that did not mutate the agent those controls describe.
- Keep profile-scoped cron execution attempts blocked on the public upstream API
  proposed in `docs/upstream-contributions.md`. The first-class interim
  assistant event is no longer blocked: Relay Android and desktop consume
  upstream `message.interim` / `response_previewed`.
- Keep Standard voice labeled host-global until upstream exposes a stable
  profile/per-request audio contract; do not emulate it through Relay on the
  vanilla path.
- Keep provider exclusion/disable filtering out of Android Manage until the
  public model-options payload identifies excluded and disabled providers.
  `include_unconfigured=1` currently re-adds indistinguishable setup rows, so
  empty models are not authoritative evidence that a provider should be hidden.
- Keep persistent approval-mode writes for multiplexed non-launch profiles
  read-only until upstream `config.get` / `config.set` bind an explicit
  `profile` to that profile's `HERMES_HOME`. Gateway contract v3 currently
  accepts `approvals.mode` but resolves it against the gateway process home;
  Android may reconcile a selected profile's `session.info.approval_mode`, but
  must not claim a profile-scoped write that upstream ignores.
- Keep gateway `model.options` profile scoping blocked until the supported
  upstream RPC accepts an explicit `profile` and documents that the returned
  provider inventory was built inside that profile's runtime scope. Android
  now keys picker results to its active profile context and rejects late
  responses after a profile switch, but it deliberately does not send an
  invented `profile` parameter. API-server fallback can use the separate,
  authenticated `/p/<profile>/api/model/options` surface when multiplexed.
- Expand the desktop upstream-baseline workflow into a live mock-provider E2E
  once the harness can boot a credential-free upstream gateway deterministically.
  The initial `ci-desktop-upstream-baseline` gate only checks a clean vanilla
  checkout and the desktop typed gateway renderer/tests.

---

## Multi-profile Phone/Threads routing — deferred (2026-07-12)

Android profile hot-swap and concurrent Gateway turns are separate from proactive
Phone/Threads routing. The relay currently has one proactive subscriber and one
shared inbound-reply queue drained by a single gateway adapter; enabling the phone
platform in several profile gateways would let those pollers race for replies.

Before advertising simultaneous multi-profile Phone/Threads support:

- Add a stable `profile` / `profile_id` to proactive messages, replies, queued
  outbound items, acknowledgements, notifications, and diagnostics.
- Partition relay reply queues by profile; each profile gateway adapter must drain
  only its own queue.
- Key Android Threads by `(connection, profile, chat_id)` and route replies to the
  originating profile even when another profile is visible.
- Show per-profile Phone-channel presence separately from chat selection and the
  server's sticky default profile.
- Preserve one relay pairing across profiles; do not require one phone pairing per
  agent.
- Define migration/fallback behavior for older relay/plugin builds that omit profile
  identity, including collision handling for identical `chat_id` values.
- Add two-profile end-to-end coverage for simultaneous outbound pushes, interleaved
  replies, offline buffering/reconnect, notification reply, and profile deletion or
  rename while messages are queued.

## Active — 1.4.1 release verification (2026-07-10)

Implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-09-1.4.1-chat-voice-enhancements.md`.
Android 1.4.0 / versionCode 22 and plugin 1.4.0 were published on 2026-07-09.
The 1.4.1 Chat and Voice waves are code-complete and merged into local `dev` for
device validation. Version bumps, public release artifacts, push, tags, production
deployment, and store upload remain separate owner-controlled steps.

Before release preparation, keep these owner/device gates explicit:

- Repeat the exact record → background/route loss → foreground reproduction on the
  newly installed debug APK; no `Listening...` / `Still working...` row may strand.
- Recheck long-run tool ordering, the screen wake lock, output waveform timing,
  final-syllable tail, and the reported PCM tap/static between sentences.
- Exercise the 1.4.1 Chat surfaces: streaming reflow, wide-table overflow, gallery
  paging/zoom/sensitive actions, unread tracking, Demo mic gate, and task-card lifecycle.
- Re-run an ordinary Chat background process through the Gateway: the current-chat
  process strip/sheet must show running state, live or snapshot output, exact Stop,
  recent completion and Dismiss; the synthetic completion must render as a process
  notice, its unsolicited assistant follow-up must appear without another prompt,
  and both must survive a socket-close/foreground history refresh without crossing
  into a different session or profile. Backgrounding with keep-alive disabled must
  also let the Gateway socket close normally instead of polling it back open.
- Start a long Standard Chat turn, wait for visible reasoning plus at least one
  running tool card, then background/force-stop/reopen the app. The same session
  must restore its partial answer, thinking/status line, tool state, and any live
  approval card; new deltas must continue without a duplicate prompt, and a turn
  that finished while offline must settle from history instead of staying busy.
- Exercise commands and presets on Standard and Realtime Voice, including ordinary
  prompts that resemble commands, explicit stop-vs-cancel behavior, Custom detection,
  and preservation of route/provider/model/voice/concurrency/barge-in choices.
- Repeat the Tink encrypted-session smoke: pair → force-stop → relaunch; the session
  must persist without an encrypted-preferences startup crash.
- Run release preparation separately: 1.4.1 versioning and public release artifacts,
  then owner-controlled `dev` → `main` merge, tag, production deployment, and upload.
- Complete the owner/Mizu GitHub triage batch, including closing #64 as superseded.

## Voice background-tasks — live findings + UX vision (2026-07-09 e2e realtime test)

Live on-device e2e (relay through `8ebb21b`, app `1.4.0-sideload` build 22, provider
`xai_realtime`). The delivery-report tooling from `5ff78da` was confirmed working
against live data during this test.

### Findings
- **Background route loss could strand a recorded turn — FIXED IN CODE; EXTENDED LIVE STRESS TEST DEFERRED (2026-07-09).** Initial logs showed valid PCM accepted by the persistent turn channel after foregrounding, but the socket had failed during background route retries and no new relay event arrived. The first fixed APK restored submission and let the background Hermes run finish, then exposed the delivery race: a slower overlapping resume handshake connected 250 ms after the valid resume, claimed relay ownership before the Android generation check, and detached the session just before the forced answer. The second installed reproduction completed the run and delivered its notification fallback, but voice stayed on `Waiting for route`: the periodic retry deadline had been created when the session was prewarmed, so its coroutine had already expired after five minutes of healthy uptime. Exiting voice mode also retained the session-owned `RECONNECTING` run; reopening rendered that orphaned pill and its close action targeted the new session instead of the detached task. Android now coalesces pending handshakes, waits for a relay-confirmed resumed socket, retains unacknowledged chunks for atomic replay, and returns a per-turn delivery result. Its retry worker lives for the session, starts a fresh bounded budget only when a route is lost, and clears that budget only after `voice.session.resumed`; bare WebSocket opens cannot reset it. Voice sessions carry a generation fence so late handoff, run, playback, and completion callbacks cannot repopulate or act on a newer session. Voice exit atomically drops detached handoff/run/confirmation UI before another session can prewarm; offline cancel rejection dismisses immediately, and a queued cancel without acknowledgement dismisses after a bounded wait. The relay requires a valid resume claim before changing ownership and isolates invalid/stale candidate failures from the active phone socket. Provider STT stays in `Transcribing` unless `VoiceRecorder.isRecording()` is true; Stop/failure settles local placeholders, late terminal deltas are ignored, and stale capture state is reconciled on resume. Route, promotion, ownership, UI-state, and chat-terminal regressions are green. The current APK is installed; repeated long-idle, background/foreground, route-churn, and terminal-exhaustion coverage remains a post-release follow-up and may drive further hardening.
- **Model-generated exact delivery is inconsistent and deferral is model-agnostic; xAI now has a deterministic path.**
  A background turn ("what do you
  think about our notes so far?") delivered `forced_summary_streaming`
  (provider-voiced, early-commit) — grok read the answer in its own voice and
  passed validation. BUT the same session's earlier turn ("check Hermes for what
  we know about Minnesota") fell back to relay TTS (`acknowledgement_not_summary`).
  A later forced-summary round on `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` also spoke a genuine
  deferral ("one moment ... I'll let you know") rather than the completed answer.
  Validator fallback is therefore correct; model choice alone does not solve the
  delivery-voice problem. xAI's provider-native `force_message` now handles
  non-structured Exact deliveries without model inference. Its raw live event
  stream and the full Android background path are verified; a recall follow-up
  also answered from that provider history without re-running Hermes.
- **think-fast selection bug fixed + live-verified.** The app's session POST omitted
  model/voice, so the settings dropdown was only a transient server-config editor
  until **Save realtime agent** was tapped. Model/voice now persist per
  connection/profile and ride every new session. On-device verification selected
  think-fast without Save, saw the relay request it and the provider's final
  resolution report it, then force-stop/relaunch restored the selection.
- **Duplicate "background task is running" — FIXED + LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-07-09).** The signoff trace captured both lines and disproved the suspected TTS mismatch: the provider first said it would check Hermes, then the broker requested a second provider response after promotion. Promotion now suppresses that second handoff when the original tool-calling response already emitted audio; silent calls still get one handoff. A deployed on-device round recorded `provider_acknowledged: true` and `spoken_handoff: false`, with only the original acknowledgement spoken. The same round confirmed the forced delivery emits one client response-start event after deduplicating xAI's `response.created` + `response.output_item.added` pair.
- **Status-speech logging gap — CLOSED / premise disproved (2026-07-09).** The raw signoff log contains both provider utterances as `voice.response.delta` text, plus the progress events; relay TTS did not speak either line. The flight recorder can reconstruct what the user heard. The real defect was redundant provider response generation, fixed above.

### Background-tasks-as-first-class-chat vision (owner ask 2026-07-09)
Theme: stop treating a background run as an ephemeral voice-only side effect —
surface it in chat like any other turn and keep its result. Overlaps the "Voice
background-run v2" chip roadmap below (items 3/4/7) but reframed around
chat/history rather than the voice chip; unify rather than build twice.
- **First-class Chat task turn — CODE-COMPLETE for 1.4.1; device verification
  remains.** Promotion attaches a short objective title and running state to
  the existing assistant row; progress, queued count, waiting/delivery, completion,
  failure, cancellation, answer text, and expandable tool detail settle that same
  identity. The authoritative answer persists in normal session history. The new
  in-flight Chat checkpoint preserves client-only task-card metadata while a turn is
  still running across a cold app restart. Metadata for an already-completed task is
  still absent from the server history schema after the checkpoint is cleared; keep
  that terminal-history case as a separate durability decision.
- **Realtime agent retains background-result context in-session — FALLBACK PATH
  DONE + SEEDING LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-07-09); NO-RERUN VERIFY PENDING.** On a FALLBACK delivery the broker now
  seeds the delivered answer into the provider's history as an assistant turn
  (`append_context_item` → silent `conversation.item.create`, no `response.create`),
  so a follow-up ("what did that say?", "expand on that") finds it durably — fixing
  the live "can't you see we ran the task?" failure; live follow-up confirmed the
  provider knew the delivered context. Provider-VOICED success already
  had its own turn in history, so it's untouched (no double-record). **Remaining:**
  (a) live on-device verify that a pure-recall post-fallback follow-up is answered
  without a re-run after the `92f9683` instruction fix; (b) the detached/promoted delivery (`_deliver_pending_background_result`)
  and the DONE-chip respeak weren't in scope — confirm whether they leave the same
  gap; (c) decide if the one-shot `native_pending_delivery_note` is now redundant
  with durable seeding or still earns its keep as an explicit correction.
- **Proper concurrent multi-task.** True N-way parallel background runs — see v2
  item 7 (deferred: needs session-per-run topology, run-id-targeted cancel,
  multi-run chip/list). Owner is now explicitly asking for it; re-rank against the
  queue rather than leaving deferred.

## Voice background-run A–E enhancement batch — SHIPPED in code (2026-07-08 PM)

Owner-approved full batch from the gap review; relay 93/93 realtime tests
green. Needs relay deploy + APK install + live verify.

- **A1 — positive summary validation + early-flush streaming.** The forced
  summary must content-overlap the Hermes answer (`_summary_overlaps_answer`;
  vacuous for bare confirmations) — blocklists chase phrasings, overlap
  doesn't. And the summary response now STREAMS: buffered only until the
  prefix (≥40 chars) clears the blocklist + shows answer overlap
  (`_maybe_commit_forced_summary_early`), then flushes and streams live —
  kills the observed "silence, then the whole answer in one burst" delay.
  Uncommitted responses still get full end-of-response validation.
- **A2 — delivered-or-alarm.** `_confirm_background_delivery`: within 30s of
  injection the summary must be done or committed-streaming, else
  `delivery_unconfirmed` is logged and the answer is force-emitted as text.
  A background answer can no longer be silently lost.
- **A3 — respeak.** `hermes.result.respeak` client message → relay respeaks
  `last_background_result` via relay TTS. Client: tapping the settled (DONE)
  chip requests it; chip stays up while it plays.
- **B — task queue (+N queued).** A long second ask is queued (FIFO, cap 3)
  instead of refused (`status: "queued"`); starts automatically when the
  current run's delivery settles (`_start_next_queued_run`, waits for the
  summary, runs as durable, spoken transition via `_queued_start_prompt`).
  Cancel clears the queue. `hermes.run.queued` event + `queued_count` on
  promoted/background_completed/get_status; chip shows "+N queued". Queue
  full → the old busy answer.
- **C1 — chip in compact mode.** The chip previously rendered ONLY in the
  focus layout; compact mode now shows it above the bottom controls
  (`bottom = 120.dp` — eyeball on device).
- **C2 — exit breadcrumb.** Exiting voice mode with a live background run
  posts a chat system notice ("Background voice task still running (+N
  queued) — Hermes will report back") via `VoiceViewModel.chatNoticeSink`
  (wired in RelayApp to the shared ChatHandler).
- **D — `_thinking` drafting signal + answer redundancy.** Relay: the
  drafted `_thinking` text is the answer of last resort when the
  response-delta path yields empty (`answer_from_thinking` log). Client:
  `_thinking` deltas drive a "Drafting the answer…" chip status line.
- **E — hygiene.** Fast lane reuses ONE side-session per voice session
  (`fast_lane_session_id`); the idle probe now injects the relay xAI OAuth
  token (`_probe_provider_options`) so it actually runs on the relay host;
  new e2e test where the provider answers the summary request with filler →
  fallback must carry the real answer
  (`test_filler_summary_triggers_fallback_delivery`).
- **Live verify list:** summary starts speaking promptly (streaming, no
  burst); filler → fallback speaks the answer; queue: two long asks →
  "queued" spoken + "+1 queued" on chip → auto-starts with spoken
  transition; DONE-chip tap respeaks; compact-mode chip visible; exit
  leaves the chat breadcrumb; probe run completes (repro + keepalive).
- **VERIFIED LIVE (rounds 3–4, 2026-07-08 PM):** queue flow end-to-end
  (queued ack → auto-start → both answers), chip +1-queued/finished states,
  fallback delivery + audibility (user's own follow-up confirmed), and two
  new gaps found + fixed same-day (see DEVLOG: whole-word/2-hit validation,
  next-turn delivery note).
- **KEEPALIVE FINAL VERDICT — no protocol message resets xAI's 900s timer
  (empirical 2026-07-08, 4 probe runs).** Repro died at 900.0s; silent-PCM
  pings died at 900.0s; server-ACKNOWLEDGED `session.update` pings
  (240/480/720s) died at 900.0s. The timer counts only real conversation
  items. **SHIPPED IN CODE (2026-07-08 PM):** picked design (b): treat
  idle-close as routine, close the Android websocket cleanly while idle,
  and let the next user turn open a fresh provider conversation seeded
  from the synced Hermes session. `_provider_keepalive_loop` is retired.
  **Remaining:** relay deploy + live >15 min idle probe to verify silent
  next-turn recovery on device.
- **Delivery input-quiet gate — SHIPPED (2026-07-08 PM, round-5 finding).**
  A background task finishing while the user was mid-utterance delivered
  over them and ended their recording. The relay now knows the user is
  speaking (live `input_audio.append` chunks stamp
  `native_last_input_audio_at`) and `_await_floor_idle_for_result` holds
  delivery until they've been quiet ≥1.5s (bounded by the existing floor
  timeout). Covers summary/fallback/queued-transition. **Client half shipped:**
  `VoiceViewModel` suppresses realtime response/audio/done only while
  `VoiceRecorder.isRecording()` is actually true. Provider STT uses
  `Transcribing`, not the capture-owned `Listening` state, so a partial
  transcript cannot wedge the mic controls or suppress its own response.
- **Audio tail cut at end of response (round-5 repro) — MITIGATED IN CODE.**
  Final word ("you?") cut hard instead of finishing smoothly. The client
  output resume tail guard is raised from 350ms to 650ms so the final
  buffered PCM has more time to drain before capture resumes. **Remaining:**
  verify on device; if the final syllable still snaps, inspect
  `RealtimePcmPlayer` drain/fade-out behavior.
- **Fallback speech says file paths (round-5 polish) — FIXED IN CODE.**
  The fallback spoke "Source: 1. Personal/Household/Househol…"; TTS-safe
  answer extraction now strips `Source:` / `Sources:` / citation lines and
  source-list path lines before relay TTS.
- **grok-voice fails the delivery instruction ~always (4/4 live rounds) —
  DEFAULT CHANGED, then REWORKED same-day.** Every observed forced summary
  was deferral filler; the validator+fallback carried every delivery.
  `speak_verbatim` was first made a direct relay-TTS default, then reworked
  to provider-voiced exact delivery (below) to keep voice continuity.
- **Provider-voiced exact delivery — xAI direct path live-verified.**
  Model-generated word-for-word instructions were not reliable. Non-structured
  `speak_verbatim` now supplies the authoritative answer to xAI's `force_message`,
  which synthesizes it in the selected realtime voice without inference and
  records a normal assistant turn. A raw live probe confirmed the full transcript,
  audio, history, and completion lifecycle. Structured results and summary modes
  remain model-generated; relay TTS remains the validator fallback. The on-device
  background path produced a clean `forced_summary_streaming` event and recall
  reused the resulting provider history without another Hermes run.
  **1.4.1 post-audit hardening is code-complete:** foreground Hermes results now
  enter the same validation/confirmation lifecycle, non-structured Exact delivery
  passes authoritative text to provider-native forced speech where supported,
  structured answers keep instruction-driven routing, an answer equal to a short
  acknowledgement is not falsely blocked, and provider tool-result/response-request
  failure emits exactly one authoritative fallback before its terminal error. Live
  verify foreground delivery and provider-failure fallback. Barge-in preemption as
  durable visible text remains open.
- **Audit leftovers (deliberate, small).** (1) DONE-chip respeak always
  renders via relay TTS — intentional determinism, but it voice-mismatches
  the exact mode's promise; candidate: provider-voiced respeak with TTS
  fallback. (2) Exact-mode answers >1400 chars are truncated with an
  appended "…" (and machine-looking text gets "…" even under the cap) —
  silent for a mode promising completeness; consider a visual "full answer
  in chat" cue on truncation.

## Voice observability (2026-07-08 assessment) — pre-RC hardening

The realtime flight recorder (per-session JSONL under
`realtime-agent-runs/`, decision-point events with reasons, task-failure
wrappers, Android `DiagnosticsLog` Voice category) is in good shape — it
carried every live-round forensics session. Three gaps before the release
candidate:

- **Buffered flight-recorder writes (minor).** `_log` open/appends per
  event on the event loop, including one line per audio chunk. Fine so
  far; switch to a buffered writer if voice sessions ever stutter under
  load — measure before optimizing.

## OpenAI realtime provider — next-RC roadmap (2026-07-08 research)

Full findings with sources in
`docs/plans/2026-07-08-openai-realtime-notes.md`. Headline: the OpenAI
provider already exists and is broker-wired
(`plugin/relay/realtime_agent/providers/openai.py`) but has never had a
recorded live round. The default is already updated to `gpt-realtime-2.1`.
Key provider contrasts vs
xAI: hard 60-min wall-clock session cap (not an inactivity timer),
out-of-band responses (`conversation:"none"` + explicit `input`), async
function calls, per-token pricing (2.1 audio $32/$64 per 1M; mini $10/$20)
vs grok's flat $0.05/min.

- **Live-verify the OpenAI provider end-to-end.** Code-complete but no
  recorded live round (all forensics are grok-voice). Run the xAI
  on-device battery (pair → voice turn → `hermes_run_task` →
  exact-delivery → queue → respeak) on 2.1. Success bar: a
  `realtime-agent-runs/` log shows a clean OpenAI session reproducing the
  flows with provider-voiced Hermes delivery.
- **Handle OpenAI's 60-min hard cap.** Distinct failure mode from xAI's
  900s inactivity close — it can cut an ACTIVE session. First confirm how
  a cap-close currently surfaces (idle-close handling is xAI-shaped, e.g.
  `_PROVIDER_IDLE_CLOSE_WS_REASON`), then add wall-clock-aware proactive
  reconnect/reseed. Success bar: a >60-min OpenAI session survives the
  cap with a proactive reseed, no user-visible break.
- **Spike out-of-band exact delivery on OpenAI
  (`conversation:"none"` + answer as `input`).** Supply the Hermes answer
  as explicit input context instead of an instructions injection the
  model may ignore. Success bar: measurably lower deferral/filler rate
  than grok forced-summary in repeated live deliveries, demoting the
  validator to a safety net.
- **Async function-call delivery on OpenAI.** OpenAI GA allows the
  session to continue while a function call is pending — a promoted
  `hermes_run_task` could complete with a real late
  `function_call_output` instead of interim-ack + synthetic
  instructions, retiring `native_pending_delivery_note`. Success bar:
  provider history reads "done" (never "still running") after a promoted
  run, verified live.
- **(Defer/eval-only) provider `semantic_vad` vs relay-owned floor.**
  Better turn-taking naturalness but moves barge-in ownership off
  `RealtimeFloor` — re-architecture, not RC scope.

## xAI voice platform moved (2026-07) — re-baseline items

xAI shipped `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` (reasoning voice model, built for
tool-calling precision) as the new flagship; `grok-voice-fast-1.0` is
deprecated and the `grok-voice-latest` ALIAS NOW RESOLVES TO THINK-FAST.
We default to the alias everywhere (`config.py:106`,
`providers/xai.py:31`), so the live model may have changed under us —
xAI's docs explicitly say to pin versioned models in production. The current
platform documents five built-in expressive voices, 20+ spoken languages,
speech tags, custom voice IDs, session resumption, and a
`turn_detection.idle_timeout_ms` re-engagement knob.

- **Decide pin-vs-alias, then re-baseline the live delivery rounds.** The
  4/4 deferral-filler verdicts may predate the alias flip — a reasoning
  voice model may comply with the exact-reading instruction where fast-1.0
  didn't. Resolved-model logging is DONE (2026-07-08):
  `provider_model_resolved` records the session.created echo, the delivery
  report prefers it, and `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` is a selectable pin.
  Remaining: run the live rounds, read the resolved ids, and decide
  pin-vs-alias for production. Success bar: we know which model each live
  round actually ran on, and the default is a deliberate choice.
- **Re-probe session lifecycle on think-fast.** The 900s
  conversation-inactivity close and the keepalive-negative verdict were
  measured pre-think-fast; xAI now documents session resumption and
  `idle_timeout_ms`. Re-run `scripts/realtime-provider-idle-probe.py`;
  if resumption is real, the idle-close-and-reseed handling can become
  reconnect-and-resume. Success bar: fresh empirical timeout/resume
  verdicts recorded in the POC doc.
- **xAI voice catalog + speech-tag UX are code-current; live verify only.** Dynamic
  discovery uses xAI's paginated `/tts/voices` surface when auth is available; the
  unauthenticated fallback matches the documented built-ins (`eve`, `ara`, `rex`,
  `sal`, `leo`; verified 2026-07-09). Voice Settings and Voice Output already expose
  the enhanced contract's expressive speech-tag toggle. Exercise both surfaces with
  a live xAI relay before release.

## Voice — on-device findings (2026-07-08 e2e realtime test)

Live e2e test (phone on 1.4.0 dev APK, relay at `789f32c`) surfaced a chained
failure — full forensics from the session event log
(`realtime-agent-20260708-122613`). **All five fixes below are in code
(2026-07-08 PM); need relay redeploy + app rebuild + a repeat of the same
test.**

- **Stuck "Thinking" pill (root of the chain) — FIXED.** The gateway streams
  drafting text as a `_thinking` pseudo-tool (`hermes.tool.delta` only, never
  `tool.completed`), and `ChatViewModel.applyRealtimeAgentEvent` created a
  ToolCall pill from the first delta of ANY tool name → a pill that spins
  "running" forever (chat + voice overlay transcript). Fix: `_`-prefixed tool
  names are internal (upstream's own hidden-tool convention) — never become
  pills; their text still feeds the detailed thinking trace. Defensive same
  guard on `hermes.tool.started`.
- **Cancel on an already-finished run killed the delivered answer — FIXED
  (relay).** `response.cancel` unconditionally flipped `hermes_run_status` to
  "cancelled" and emitted `hermes.run.cancelled` even with no run in flight
  (observed: user cancelled 10s after completion — invited by the stuck pill —
  and the Tokyo answer was never spoken). Now the Hermes-run half of cancel
  only fires when a run is actually active; speech-stop always happens.
- **Model read the 32-char run ID aloud — FIXED (relay).** The interim ack
  and the forced-summary prompt both handed the model `run_id`
  (payload/metadata). Removed everywhere model-visible (get_status/cancel
  default to the active run; the client gets ids via events) + explicit
  "never say run/session IDs aloud" in all three instruction sites.
- **Delivery spoke deferral filler instead of the answer — FIXED (relay).**
  The forced-summary validator caught run-id speech (that saved the Minnesota
  answer via fallback) but not "One moment while I look that up. I'll report
  back as soon as I have the info." — Tokyo's answer was lost behind that
  filler. Added deferral phrases (one moment / report back / looking into /
  i'll look / as soon as i have) to `_bad_forced_summary_reason`; summary
  prompt reworded to "speak the answer NOW". Tests:
  `plugin/tests/test_realtime_summary_validation.py` (5) + updated cancel
  route test; realtime batch 69/69 green.
- **Stale pre-lead — FIXED (relay).** A new run's "I'll check Hermes"
  progress event carried the PREVIOUS run's run_id + completed_tool_count
  (fires before the per-run reset). Now sends null/zero identity when no run
  is in flight; keeps the active run's identity during a fast-lane attempt.
- **Background-run chip vanished the instant the waveform came back — FIXED
  (client, second finding same day).** The chip was nulled at the first
  summary-audio byte ("the DELIVERING chip has done its job"), so it
  disappeared exactly when speech started — reading as the task being lost.
  New `BackgroundRunPhase.DONE`: on first summary audio (or the 20s
  no-audio watchdog) the chip settles to "Background task finished." — solid
  dot, frozen ticker — lingers 10s (`DONE_CHIP_LINGER_MS`), then
  auto-dismisses; ✕ on a DONE chip is a local dismiss (never a cancel); a
  new promoted run replaces a lingering DONE chip and cancels its timer;
  progress/tool/reconnect handlers can't reanimate a settled chip. Verify:
  chip visibly settles + lingers while the answer is being spoken, ✕ during
  DONE doesn't emit a relay cancel.

## Voice — on-device findings (2026-07-07 realtime test)

Surfaced during a live realtime-voice test with a long, many-tool-call background run. (The duplicate-error-toast + no-dismiss issue from the same test shipped this session — see DEVLOG 2026-07-07.)

- **Tool-call status pills stuck / ordering wrong — FIXED, needs on-device re-verify (2026-07-07).** After the recent background-run-chip work (`8dc874c`/`9554c7c`), the owner found on-device that the "Thinking" indicator can get stuck and that the relative order of tool-call pills vs. the agent's reply doesn't cleanly track what actually happened. Root cause was narrower than first suspected — `VoiceUiState.responseText` is write-only for the realtime path (nothing renders it), so the actual stuck surface was the `BackgroundRunChip`: no `hermes.tool.completed`/`hermes.tool.failed` branch in `VoiceViewModel`'s event handler meant a finished tool's `statusLine` stayed pinned at `phase=RUNNING` until the next unrelated event overwrote it. Fixed (`VoiceViewModel.kt:2619`): clears the finished tool's status line, advances `completedToolCount`, leaves `DELIVERING` alone. The ordering half was `CompactTranscriptRow` (`VoiceModeOverlay.kt`) rendering reply text above the tool rows that produced it — reordered to tool-rows-first (chronological). The per-message `ToolCall` transcript rows were already correct (untouched). `:app:compileSideloadDebugKotlin` green. **Needs on-device re-verify** (long multi-tool background run: chip never shows a stale finished-tool name; reply reads below its tool calls, not above) before the release resumes.
- **Tap/static click between sentences (realtime PCM playback) — NEEDS on-device audio investigation.** Suspected discontinuity at TTS chunk/sentence boundaries in `RealtimePcmPlayer` (a buffer underrun between segments, or a pop when a new segment's `AudioTrack` write starts). Capture head-position / underrun logs during a multi-sentence reply to confirm before touching the buffer sizing or adding a boundary crossfade/fade. Related to the existing "Realtime-PCM waveform output gating" note.
- **Screen-wake-lock for chat/voice — SHIPPED (2026-07-07).** The app previously relied entirely on the OS screen-timeout during both chat and voice mode. Added `KeepScreenOnWhile(enabled)` (`ui/components/OrientationOverride.kt`, `Window.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` via `DisposableEffect` — the same Android-recommended visible-surface mechanism `power/WakeLockManager.kt`'s doc comment already pointed at for a background/no-window case), wired at the `ChatScreen` root as a single call site: `enabled = voiceUiState.voiceMode || isStreaming`. Rationale (matches other apps): voice mode is a call-like continuous session (Assistant/phone-call convention) so it holds the flag for the whole time the overlay is open, regardless of Idle/Listening/Thinking/Speaking sub-state; chat only holds it while a reply is actively streaming (video-playback convention) — idle reading/scrolling falls back to the OS default, matching WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal norms rather than pinning the screen on for a static transcript. Deliberately a single owner of the window flag (not ref-counted) — see the function's doc comment before adding a second caller. **Needs on-device confirmation**: screen stays on for the whole voice session incl. silent gaps, screen stays on only during active streaming in chat (not while idle), and the flag is correctly released on exiting voice mode / when a stream ends.

## Voice background-run v2 (2026-07-06 roadmap — post plugin-v1.3.0)

The v1 shape shipped in plugin-v1.3.0 (single durable run, free floor during
background work, busy answer, deliver-on-reattach, exit-detaches / chip-✕-
cancels). Ranked next increments, in value-per-complexity order:

1. **Fast lane — SHIPPED in code (2026-07-08; needs relay deploy + live voice
   verify).** `_run_fast_lane_task` in `broker.py`: while a detached
   (promoted/durable) run holds the background slot, a second
   `hermes_run_task` first runs INLINE on a separate ephemeral Hermes session
   (`session_id=None`) within the normal grace window; grace-elapse, a
   known-long tool start (`_long_tool_hints`), explicit `mode=background`, or
   promotion-off all abandon it and fall through to the (reworded) busy
   answer. Touches NONE of the session's `hermes_*` run state — run_id/
   status/progress/chip stay owned by the in-flight run — and emits no client
   events of its own (bounded by grace; a chip would fight the detached
   run's). Events: `voice.hermes_fast_lane.completed/abandoned/error` in the
   session log. Tests: `plugin/tests/test_realtime_fast_lane.py` (7) +
   updated `test_second_run_task_answers_busy_without_orphaning_first`
   (per-stream cancellation tracking). **Residuals:** (a) context injection —
   the ephemeral session gets only the task text + interface context, not
   rolling conversation context (broker keeps no per-turn transcript; the
   model is instructed to pass self-contained task text); (b) an abandoned
   attempt may still finish server-side into the ephemeral session
   (at-least-once, unread) — same property as promotion; (c) live verify:
   during a long background run, ask a quick second question → answered
   inline; ask a second long thing → busy answer unchanged.
2. **Task queue — SHIPPED + LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-07-08).** FIFO cap 3,
   start-next-on-completion, spoken transition, cancel-clears-queue, and the
   `+N queued` chip all landed in the A-E batch above.
3. **Chip tap-through to the transcript** — the run executes on a real
   gateway session, so full tool calls/outputs already live in that session's
   history; make the chip (or the finished turn) open it. Cheapest "see tool
   output" step.
4. **Live tool-output sheet** — chip expands to a run timeline (tool name,
   status, capped ~500-char output snippet). Relay adds a truncated output
   field to `hermes.tool.*` events; client renders a lane (reuse the
   `SubagentLane` pattern).
5. **Injection framing (recorded earlier, still open)** — on providers with
   native async function calling, leave the tool call pending and deliver the
   real `function_call_output` late instead of interim-ack + synthetic
   instruction text. Needs a live xAI parity check first.
6. **Pending-result FIFO** — `pending_background_result` is a single slot and
   remains correct for the shipped serial queue. Generalize it only with N-way
   concurrent background runs so multiple completions can race while detached.
7. **Full N-way concurrent background runs — deliberately deferred.** Needs
   session-per-run topology (a gateway session serializes turns), which
   fragments conversation context, multiplies delivery/floor/failure modes,
   and needs run-id-targeted cancel + a multi-run chip. Only worth it when
   two *long* tasks genuinely need parallel wall-clock; revisit if the queue
   feels slow in practice.

## Open-issue resolution batch (2026-07-06) — owner GitHub actions + deferrals

Plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-06-open-issue-resolution.md` (13 open issues triaged;
fix-state claims verified against tags with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`).
This historical batch remains owner-controlled. The bounded new-issue triage
lane may post one clearly identified first response and basic type/area labels,
but it does not execute backlog actions. Every comment, close, relabel, and
milestone below remains an owner action deliberately queued here:

- [ ] **#131** — close: fixed by `3573ba8` (PR #136), shipped android-v1.2.5
      (reporter was on 1.2.3). Optionally re-check Play vitals for the
      "Invalid URL host" signature on ≥1.2.5 first.
- [ ] **#129** — close: fixed by `99b9cf1` (PR #128), shipped android-v1.2.4
      (owner already promised v1.2.4 in-thread).
- [ ] **#124** — post the promised follow-up + close: fixed by `802385c`
      (PR #125), first shipped android-v1.2.3.
- [ ] **#70** — close both prongs: original keyset force-close fixed `48ddba5`
      (android-v1.1.0); the in-thread TLS/Tailscale crash is #124's bug, fixed
      android-v1.2.3. Invite reopening if it recurs on ≥1.2.3.
- [ ] **#94** — pull Play Console vitals for the versionCode-13 / Z Fold7
      cluster; hardening shipped `a455e46` (android-v1.2.0). Confirm no
      recurrence on v1.2.x, then close.
- [ ] **#155 / #154** — support comments + close as user-config: `localhost`
      on the phone points at the phone itself (#154 is the downstream probe
      failure of the same misconfig). Link the new troubleshooting entry once
      it deploys. Relabel away from `bug`/`area:plugin`.
- [ ] **#146** — needs-info comment (Tailscale up on the phone? follow-up
      Error entry? agent bound on the tailnet address?); close as support if
      no response.
- [ ] **#166** — relabel `area:plugin` → `area:android`; reply with the root
      cause (phone drops the SSE socket on long local-model turns; upstream
      finishes + persists the answer; app now recovers it) and credit the
      reporter's `supports_async_delivery` instinct. Ask: screen off during
      the hang? does reopening the session later show the answer?
- [ ] **#165** — reply: both failure modes confirmed (absolute `plugin.`
      imports under the native loader; install.sh layout assumptions); fix
      ships as plugin-v1.3.1. The uv-pip gap they mention was already fixed in
      plugin-v1.1.0+. Owner must e2e the fix on the official Docker image.
- [ ] **#145** — confirm-triage reply; on-device check after fix (max font +
      display size, all 5 slides); close after the next android-v* release.
- [ ] **#144** — close after the next android-v* release demonstrates the
      2-asset layout + new Download block; optionally edit the published
      android-v1.2.6 release body to drop the "Parity/testing artifact" wording.
- [ ] **#121** — label (`enhancement` + area) and milestone onto the next
      `cli-v*` release; it's scheduled feature work, not part of this batch.

Deferred from the batch (coordination / decisions):

- **Localhost-advisory UI wiring** (`ConnectionWizard` / `ConnectionDetailScreen`
  `supportingText`) — the util (`ServerAddress.loopbackHostWarning`) + tests land
  in WS-C, but the wizard wiring waits on the parallel connections-UI workstream
  to avoid colliding in those files.
- **#166 optional hardening** — extend the opt-in keep-alive foreground service
  to cover an in-flight SSE turn (reduces disconnect incidence; googlePlay-flavor
  FGS declaration implications). Recovery poller ships without it.
- **Upstream PR candidates from #166** — intentional detached-run semantics on
  client disconnect in `_handle_session_chat_stream`; pollable/resumable
  session-turn status. Decide whether to file against hermes-agent.
- **"Vanilla Hermes" docs naming** — app dropped the label in v1.2.2; docs still
  use it as a concept term. Owner decision whether to retire it docs-wide
  (WS-F only fixes verbatim UI-label quotes).
- **Docker venv pivot for install.sh** — beyond steer-to-native: optionally
  create a dedicated relay venv under a writable path so the full installer
  works in-container.

Implementation-batch follow-ups (from the per-branch reviews):

- **#166 recovery: empty-session fail-fast.** `HermesApiClient.getMessages()`
  maps fetch failures to `emptyList()`, so the recovery poller can't distinguish
  "server unreachable" from "session genuinely empty" — a `Result`-returning
  history read would let the never-landed-send fail-fast also cover a dropped
  FIRST message of a fresh session (today that case polls to the cap).
- **#166 recovery cap.** Recovery gives up after 30 minutes; longer turns still
  land in session history but only surface after a manual reload. Consider a
  "keep waiting" affordance if real turns exceed the cap.
- **CI android slice.** `ServerAddressTest` + `IssueReportAndDiagnosticsTest`
  added to the focused `--tests` slice; the Robolectric/MockWebServer recovery
  tests and the compact-onboarding Roborazzi test stay local-only (same
  precedent as `StoreScreenshotTest`) until the broad-suite hang (#32) is fixed.
- **Skills docs still cite editable-only fixes.** `skills/devops/hermes-relay-pair/SKILL.md`
  and `skills/android/SKILL.md` document `python -m plugin.pair` + `pip install -e`
  as the ModuleNotFoundError fix — add the native-layout equivalent when the
  #165 branch ships.
- **Dashboard API tests not CI-visible.** `plugin/dashboard/test_plugin_api.py`
  isn't discovered by `unittest discover -s plugin/tests` and needs
  fastapi/httpx — wire into a CI runner or move under plugin/tests with skips.
- **Desktop tool-count drift.** `user-docs/desktop/index.md` counts client-side
  handlers (clipboard/screenshot/open_in_editor) that have no server-side
  `desktop_*` registration in `plugin/tools/desktop_tool.py` — reconcile the
  advertised set; also `user-docs/desktop/pairing.md` wrongly says Android uses
  `~/.hermes/remote-sessions.json` (it's Keystore/EncryptedSharedPrefs; the file
  is shared with the Ink TUI). CLAUDE.md Key Files also still says 18/24 tools.
- **Info-report button label.** The diagnostics Report button reads "Report"
  even when the first tap only reveals the expectation field — a "Continue"
  label would make the two-step flow clearer.

## Connections UI / status banner (2026-06-30 restructure follow-ups)

The Connections screen was split into a scannable list + a tabbed detail screen
(Overview / Routes / Advanced / Security). Connection-status presentation went
through a few iterations (persistence-tiered top strip → no-float → …) and **landed
on a two-connection model (2026-07-01):**
- **Chat/agent** (gateway/API) → the chat header **subtitle** swaps model ⇄
  "Reconnecting…"/"Connecting…"/"Disconnected" (WhatsApp-style; `ChatScreen`).
- **Relay socket** (bridge/terminal/relay-voice) → the **bottom `RelayStatusStrip`**
  amber "Reconnecting…" cue only.
- **No top-of-screen surface** for connection status at all (no strip, banner, or
  float). Route changes are **ambient only** (the bottom strip's route label updates;
  no explicit "switched to Tailscale" notification — decided 2026-07-01).

Deferred:

- ~~**Dead connection-status-surface code.**~~ *(Cleaned up 2026-07-01.)* Removed the
  now-unused top-strip machinery: `ConnectionHandoffBanner` + `ConnectionStatusBanner`
  (+ `PulsingSyncIcon`), `ConnectionStatusSurface` + `presentationSurface()` +
  `ConnectionStatusSurfaceTest`. **`ConnectionStatusToast` retained** as a parked
  general-purpose toast primitive (the only surface with a live multi-step stepper;
  decouple from `ConnectionStatusSnapshot` + rename to `StatusToast` on first reuse).
- **Bottom-strip route-change flash (optional).** Route change is ambient-only for
  now. If a "switched to Tailscale" confirmation is wanted, surface it briefly in the
  **bottom strip** (where the route label already lives), not the top — keeps the
  no-top-chrome principle. The VM still detects + logs the change (`lastConnectedRole`).
- ~~**Resume suppression covers only the handoff path.**~~ *(Fixed 2026-07-01.)* Added
  `postResumeQuiet`: a benign background→foreground re-handshake no longer flashes the
  bottom-strip "Reconnecting…" cue (the health "Connecting" path used to leak it).
- **Stuck "Reconnecting" cue during a sustained/flapping outage (backoff gaps).**
  Confirmed in a both-sides trace (DEVLOG 2026-07-01): when a reconnect attempt fails
  (`Reconnecting→Disconnected`) **no handoff branch matches**, so the active
  "Reconnecting" handoff persists on its 30s backstop — including during the backoff
  *gap* where the socket is idle (`Disconnected`, not actually trying) and during the
  20s connect timeout. The cue then clears on the timer with no resolution ("no toast
  after"). The post-resume case is fixed (`postResumeQuiet`); this sustained/non-resume
  case is not. Fix idea: drive the bottom-strip cue off the LIVE
  `relayConnectionState`/`relayUiState` (show only while actually Connecting/
  Reconnecting), and clear the active handoff when `relayUiState` goes `Stale`/`Expired`
  so the live "Relay unreachable" state surfaces instead of a stuck cue. Deferred:
  hard to repro on a stable network; also risks surfacing the take-space "unreachable"
  banner more often on a chronically-flappy link (decide the escalation threshold).
- **Rapid real flaps still churn the cue/subtitle.** On a genuinely flapping network
  (DEVLOG 2026-07-01 — Samsung adaptive Wi-Fi cycling the radio), each real drop→recover
  toggles the bottom-strip cue (relay) and, if chat drops too, the header subtitle. Now
  unobtrusive (no top surface), but a short coalescing/debounce would quiet a
  chronically-flappy link further. Deferred — the flap is environmental, not an app bug.
- **Non-active connection detail is Overview-only.** Routes/Advanced/Security tabs
  appear only for the active connection (they read the single active-connection VM
  state); a non-active connection shows a "Switch to this connection" CTA. A future
  read-only preview of a non-active connection's saved routes could be nice.
- **Store screenshot regeneration.** The `07_connections` scene mock was updated to
  the new list design; confirm the regenerated PNG + Play-graphics export at
  release-prep (only auto-publishes on a `main` release merge).

## Chat UI/UX polish (2026-07-01 readability pass)

A 5-agent audit compared the chat surface to Discord/Telegram/Messenger/iMessage/
GitHub-mobile. **Shipped this pass (pending on-device verification):** a chat-tuned
  `markdownTypography()` ramp (headings were falling through to M3 display roles —
  h1=`displayLarge` 57sp in this app's scale — so a `#` was a billboard; now h1≈20sp
  scaling down, list/paragraph unified to 15sp/21sp, primary assistant prose moved
  to the theme's full-contrast `onSurface`, inline+fenced code 13sp, `textLink`
accent+underline) in `MarkdownContent.kt`; timestamp gated to `isLastInGroup` (was on
every bubble) + grouping breaks on a >5min gap (`GROUP_GAP_MS`) so a resumed
conversation gets its own beat; long-press haptic on the action menu; streaming dots
gated to pre-first-token. Deferred:

- **Streaming↔final render parity — live reflow check remains.** Blank-terminated,
  unambiguous top-level prose/headings use the final Markdown renderer during
  generation while the active tail stays lightweight. Completion intentionally
  parses one full CommonMark document so global link references, indentation, and
  nested containers remain correct; the viewport now anchors that same remeasure.
  Verify lists, tables, quotes, HTML, nested fences, and reference links on-device.
- **Tail-corner on last-in-group only (design decision).** The audit flagged the
  per-bubble bottom tail as "half-implemented," but it's a deliberate aesthetic
  (every bubble tails). Switching to iMessage-style "tail on the last bubble only"
  changes the look — get design intent before flipping. `isLastInGroup` is now
  meaningful (grouping breaks on gaps) so it's ready if wanted.
- **Assistant bubble width decoupled from user.** Both cap at 300dp though only the
  assistant carries markdown/code; let the assistant run wider (~92% of available /
  340–360dp cap) so fences wrap/scroll later. Keep user ~300dp.
- **Token counts out of the bubble; delivery → glyph.** Move `TokenDisplay` to a
  long-press "message info" sheet; collapse `Sending…/Delivered/Not sent` to a single
  trailing check/clock/! glyph on the last bubble (declutters every message).
- **SelectionContainer vs long-press conflict.** Long-pressing the words can start
  text selection instead of opening Copy/Quote. Pick one owner (drop
  `SelectionContainer`, expose Copy via the menu — chat-app norm — or move actions to a
  kebab). Needs on-device confirmation of the current conflict first.
- **Drop the no-op tap ripple on bubbles.** The 1.4.1 jump-to-bottom unread badge is
  code-complete; `combinedClickable(onClick={})` still ripples on a normal bubble tap.
- **Sessions per-turn reconciliation.** Current upstream includes assistant/tool
  rows in `run.completed.messages`, but Android still uses a full profile-aware
  history read for successful Sessions turns so older servers and persisted message
  boundaries remain safe. Replace it only with a bounded partial-turn merge that
  preserves the prior transcript and client-only fields, with a full-history fallback
  when the completion payload is absent or incomplete.
- **Full 15-role `Typography` + metadata contrast.** Type.kt declares only 7 roles at
  0 tracking; the rest inherit M3 defaults with 0.1–0.5sp tracking (ChatScreen uses
  several) — declare all 15 for one coherent scale. Separately, floor muted-metadata
  alpha at ≥0.6 and verify ≥4.5:1 per theme (11sp timestamps were alpha 0.5 over
  `onSurfaceVariant` ≈ 2–2.5:1; the surviving timestamp is now 0.6).

## Realtime voice (ADR 33) follow-ups — 2026-07-01 robustness batch

The deliver-on-reattach / adaptive-promotion / milestone-speech / resume-retry /
prewarm batch shipped (see DEVLOG 2026-07-01). Deferred:

- **Result injection framing — FIXED in code, deployed, needs live e2e voice verify (2026-07-07).** The completed background summary, the background-handoff acknowledgement, and the forced-Hermes preamble were all injected as a synthetic *user* message (`send_text` → `conversation.item.create` role=user) — the model saw a fake turn where "the user" said things like "Hermes has already handled the user's previous voice request..." Research turned up a cleaner mechanism than the one originally guessed at: `response.create` supports a per-response `instructions` field that overrides the session system prompt for one response only, **without creating any conversation item at all** — confirmed supported by both providers (OpenAI's own docs; xAI's Voice Agent API docs explicitly show the same `response.create.response.instructions` shape). `conversation: "none"` (true out-of-band, not in history) is OpenAI-only and was deliberately NOT used — we want the spoken summary to land in real conversation history so follow-ups like "what was that again" still work; only the injection *transport* changed, not where the turn ends up. Implementation: `RealtimeAgentConnection.request_response()` (`providers/base.py`) gained an optional `instructions: str | None` kwarg; both `providers/openai.py` and `providers/xai.py` implement it identically (`{"type": "response.create", "response": {"instructions": ...}}` only when instructions are given, else the original bare `response.create`); all 4 broker-authored injection call sites (`broker.py:1244, 2113, 2352, 2560`) switched from `send_text(prompt)` to `request_response(instructions=prompt)`. The one genuine passthrough site (`broker.py:699`, real client-supplied text) is untouched. `python -m unittest discover -s plugin/tests` — 1073/1074 green (the one failure is the pre-existing, already-documented `test_reads_hermes_xai_oauth_credential_pool` fixture gap, unrelated). **Deployed to the relay (2026-07-07) — still needs a real on-device voice session** confirming the model still speaks a natural summary when driven by `instructions` alone (no preceding fake user turn); watch for a background-task delivery in particular since that's the highest-traffic call site. **Confirmed live-verified (2026-07-08)** via the raw event log on the relay: a background run (~4min, terminal tool ×9-10) delivered its spoken summary correctly through the new `request_response(instructions=...)` path (`voice.response.started` → `voice.output_audio.delta` ×N → `voice.response.done`, clean).
- **xAI closes the realtime session after 900s of true silence — SETTLED (2026-07-08).** Live logs showed the provider closing after ~900s of zero conversation activity. Four probe runs proved no keepalive works: the repro, silent-PCM appends, and acknowledged `session.update` pings all died at exactly 900.0s. **Current code path:** idle-close is routine provider-session expiry; the broker closes Android cleanly with no `voice.error`, the old keepalive loop is gone, and the next user turn opens a fresh provider conversation seeded from the durable Hermes session. **Remaining:** relay deploy + on-device >15 min idle recovery verify.
- **Realtime voice: provider-answered turn durability — gateway drain + provenance badge SHIPPED (2026-07-08); app-restart persistence still open.** Shipped in code (needs on-device verify with the rest of the voice batch): (a) **gateway trace drain** — a gateway-configured turn with unsynced synthetic sync messages (voice intents / card dispatches / provider-answered realtime turns) now forces itself onto the sessions SSE route so the traces actually reach the server (previously "leave them for the next SSE turn" meant *never* on a gateway-primary phone). Deliberately narrow: only with an existing session id + the sessions fallback route (a stateless completions/runs detour would drop the turn itself from the transcript) and only on the default profile (a non-default profile's gateway session lives in its own state.db — the shared api_server POST would 404 and fail the user's turn; that residual defer case is accepted). The synced-mark guard now checks the route the turn actually *dispatched* on (`effectiveEndpoint`), also fixing a latent duplicate-resend for forced-SSE voice turns. (b) **provenance badge on reload** — `RealtimeTurnSyncBuilder.stripProvenanceMarker()` recognizes the synced `[Realtime Agent provider-native voice turn: …]` marker in loaded history, strips the bracket noise, restores the quiet "Realtime Agent" badge (same chip live turns get), and drops the superseded local clientOnly bubble so the exchange doesn't render twice. **Still open — app-restart loss:** unsynced traces are in-memory only; a restart before the next Hermes turn loses them. A fix needs a client-side pending-trace store (DataStore) plus answers to: which session should late traces sync into (voice binds per-session; the next turn may be a different session/profile), and restore-as-bubbles vs builder-side-only. A true flush-on-voice-exit is NOT implementable without an upstream append-messages API (every chat POST runs the agent); the drain above narrows the exposure window to "restart before the very next turn." Deliberately NOT a separate relay transcript store (forks the conversation).
- ~~**Realtime voice: subtle "Voice" provenance chip (2026-07-08).**~~ **Done via the durability item above** — turned out message-level "Realtime Agent"/"Voice" badges already rendered for live turns (`MessageBubble.kt` VolumeUp chips); the actual gap was reloaded history showing raw bracket provenance instead of the badge, now fixed by the marker → badge restore.
- **Pre-existing test failure:** `test_realtime_voice_routes.py::
  test_reads_hermes_xai_oauth_credential_pool` fails at HEAD too (`token is None`) —
  looks like an environment/fixture dependency on a local xai oauth pool, not a code
  regression. Diagnose or gate on the fixture.
- **Standard voice `delegate_task(background=true)` nudge — SHIPPED then
  REVERTED same-day (2026-07-08); premise disproven by the VERIFY-FIRST
  check.** The nudge (a `STABLE_VOICE_INTERFACE_CONTEXT` line telling the
  model to background long voice asks) was implemented, then the companion
  verify-first item below was actually checked against upstream source and
  killed it: **`delegate_task(background=true)` never dispatches async on the
  api_server surface at all.** Upstream downgrades it to synchronous
  execution (issue #10760): every api_server route binds
  `async_delivery=False` (`gateway/platforms/api_server.py` ~4000), and
  `tools/delegate_tool.py` (~2775) checks
  `gateway.session_context.async_delivery_supported()` and runs the batch
  inline with a "ran SYNCHRONOUSLY" note — "the adapter's send() is a no-op,
  so a background dispatch would silently never re-enter the conversation."
  Since ALL standard voice turns are forced onto SSE (ephemeral prompt slot),
  the nudge would have made the model block just as long (plus subagent
  overhead) while claiming it backgrounded. Reverted in `45c7ef4`. If a
  "don't hold the voice floor" behavior is ever wanted on the standard path,
  it needs the upstream async-delivery gap fixed first (a poll/webhook
  delivery channel for stateless sessions — upstream contribution), or the
  Relay realtime engine, which already has real background runs (ADR 33).
- ~~**Standard voice: speak a delegated result if the overlay is still open when
  it lands.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-07-08 — premise gone.** There is no delayed
  `delegate_task` completion turn on the standard voice path: the api_server
  surface downgrades `background=true` to synchronous execution (see the
  reverted-nudge entry above), so the "delegated result landing later" case
  this wanted to speak cannot occur on SSE. On the gateway transport a
  background completion does re-enter as a new turn — whether the phone's
  gateway client renders an unsolicited idle-time turn is a separate
  (text-chat) question, tracked nowhere yet; add it if gateway background
  delegation becomes a used flow on phone text chat.
- **VERIFIED 2026-07-08 — a `delegate_task` completion turn can NEVER reach an
  api_server-sourced session, because upstream never dispatches one there.**
  Answered by reading current upstream source (clone @ `5057f03bf`): the
  question is moot one layer earlier than expected. Every api_server route
  binds the session context with `async_delivery=False`
  (`gateway/platforms/api_server.py` ~4000, "the stateless HTTP path");
  `tools/delegate_tool.py` (~2775) consults
  `gateway.session_context.async_delivery_supported()` and, when false, runs
  the whole batch SYNCHRONOUSLY with an explanatory note (issue #10760) —
  there is no detached child, no completion event, no forged turn. The
  `_async_delegation_watcher` → `_inject_watch_notification` →
  `adapter.handle_message()` path only ever fires for sessions whose origin
  routes to a real push-capable platform adapter (gateway chats, Discord,
  etc.). Consequences applied same-day: the voice delegate nudge was reverted
  and the speak-on-overlay item closed (entries above).

## Relay-enhanced standard voice for background tasks — research (2026-07-08)

**Verdict: NO — don't build it.** Full owner ask + Fable 5 agent research (cross-
checked against hermes-desktop's actual source, found in the local upstream
monorepo clone). Three lanes already cover "a long voice request survives and
reports back": (1) standard voice isn't a blocking call — a long turn just keeps
streaming, and the #166 SSE-recovery poller + `TurnCompleteNotifier` already
recover + notify on a dropped socket, zero relay involvement; (2) upstream's own
`delegate_task(background=true)` is the standard-path equivalent of the realtime
broker's `hermes_run_task` promotion — the model can detach a long task itself;
(3) hermes-desktop's own voice hook (`apps/desktop/src/app/chat/composer/hooks/
use-voice-conversation.ts` in the upstream monorepo — verified, zero mentions of
background/promotion) is the same thin synchronous record→transcribe→submit→speak
loop with NO background awareness; their background-task UX lives entirely in the
chat/composer surface (a status stack + native OS notification, never spoken) —
convergent with Android's existing background-run chip / `SubagentLane` /
`TurnCompleteNotifier`, not a gap to fill. Building a relay-side background layer
for standard voice would mean proxying an upstream-only surface through the relay
or monkey-patching deeper than the accepted `plugin/enhancements/` seam — against
the standard-path rule — to duplicate machinery ADR 33 itself calls the most
fragile code in `broker.py`, for an audience realtime already serves better.
Action items from this research are above (prompt nudge, speak-on-overlay-open
polish, the api_server-routing verify-first gate).
- **Prewarm cost watch.** Voice-mode entry now opens the provider session before the
  first utterance. If users habitually open+close voice mode without speaking, idle
  provider sessions cost connect/teardown churn — consider a short "no utterance in
  N min → close" reaper if it shows up in practice.
- **E2E verification pending** for the new paths on-device: deferred result spoken on
  resume after a mid-run drop; proactive notification when the session dies for good;
  busy answer on a second task; adaptive promotion timing; first-turn latency with
  prewarm; the live background-run chip (progress line/steps/timer, RECONNECTING and
  DELIVERING phases, ✕-to-cancel).
- **Ambient background-run visibility OUTSIDE voice mode.** Exiting the voice overlay
  mid-run leaves no on-screen indication a task is still going (the run survives and
  the result arrives as a notification via the proactive fallback). Surface a small
  indicator on the chat screen — natural home is the bottom `RelayStatusStrip`, which
  the connection-management work owns → **coordinate before implementing**.
- **Dev-env note:** the local hermes-agent app venv (`AppData/Local/hermes/...`) can
  prune `aiohttp`/`segno` (uv sync), breaking `python -m unittest plugin.tests.*` with
  ModuleNotFoundError — restore with
  `uv pip install --python <venv>/Scripts/python.exe aiohttp segno`.

## Phone as a Hermes platform (proactive agent → phone)

Phase 1 (end-to-end spine) shipped on `Codename-11/phone-platform` — `send_message target=phone` → loopback `/phone/message` → relay `ProactiveChannel` → phone WSS → system notification, gated off by default (`PHONE_ENABLED` server-side + "Let Hermes message me" app-side + pairing). Remaining:

- **Phase 2a — dedicated "Hermes" inbox surface.** An always-present inbound conversation/section for agent-initiated messages (reuse chat *rendering* components, do NOT restyle — chat-ux worktree owns visuals). Land proactive messages there in addition to the notification. `ProactiveMessageHandler.onReceived` + `dispatch()` are the seams already in place; key the surfacing on `ProactiveMessage.surfacing` (notification / inbox / session / default = notification + inbox). Needs a small persistence store + a nav entry.
- **Phase 2b — session injection.** Deliver a proactive message into the relevant/active chat session (continue that conversation) when `surfacing == "session"`. Keep the `ChatViewModel` change SMALL/localized (one injection entry point) to avoid conflicting with the chat-ux branch.
- **Phase 2c — two-way reply. SHIPPED + DEVICE-VERIFIED (2026-06-29).** All three legs landed: (1) inline-reply notification (`RemoteInput` + `ProactiveReplyReceiver`) + a reply box in the Hermes inbox; (2) `proactive.reply` envelope (app→relay) buffered by `ProactiveChannel` + a loopback `GET /phone/replies` long-poll; (3) `PhoneAdapter.connect()` inbound loop drains `/phone/replies` → `handle_message()` so the reply continues the originating conversation (keyed by `chat_id`/`reply_to`), and the agent's answer rides the existing `send()` back. Inbound source is `role_authorized=True` (the relay pairing layer is the auth boundary), so replies work without `PHONE_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`. Verified via `python -m unittest` (proactive + phone tests) and `./gradlew :app:lint`, then **end-to-end on-device (2026-06-29)** after two faults the device test surfaced (see DEVLOG): `PhoneAdapter.connect()` was missing the `is_reconnect` kwarg the gateway passes (→ `TypeError`, adapter never connected, reply loop never polled); and a stale duplicate plugin copy in the user-plugins dir was winning the loader's name-dedup, so the gateway loaded old code and ignored every deploy. Residual deferred (below): outbound buffering / a persistent send-when-reconnected queue (currently the agent's answer `503`s and is **lost** if the phone's subscription dropped); inbound media in replies (text-first in v1).
- **Phase 3 — full controls.** DataStore-backed `ProactivePreferences` expanding `data/ProactivePrefs.kt`: quiet hours / DND (suppress or defer), per-profile push scoping, rate limiting (debounce/cap), and TTS-on-voice (route to the existing voice player API when a voice turn is active — call, don't modify, the voice path). Surface on the existing `ProactiveSettingsScreen`. Also: a persistent outbound-reply queue so a reply typed while the relay is disconnected (notification inline-reply in a killed process, or a dropped WS) is sent on the next connect instead of dropped.

**Maintainer verification (live box + device — can't be done off-device):**
- Live gateway must discover the plugin (`~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay` → `plugin/`) and `plugins.enabled` must include `hermes-relay` for the `phone` platform to register. Confirm `phone` appears in `hermes gateway status` with `PHONE_ENABLED=1`.
- End-to-end: with the app paired + "Let Hermes message me" on, run `send_message target=phone text=...` (and a cron `deliver=phone`) and confirm a notification on the device. Verify 503 (no phone) and the off-by-default gates.
- **Phase 2c reply round-trip — ✅ DONE (verified on-device 2026-06-29).** Confirmed: agent → phone notification → inline reply → drained through the relay's loopback `GET /phone/replies` (different process) → `handle_message` (`role_authorized=True`, no `PHONE_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`) → agent answer back in the *same* thread. Both fixes required (see DEVLOG / the Phase 2c bullet above).
- **Cron `deliver=phone` live certification pending.** The plugin now registers its standalone sender and enumerates the canonical phone home through the upstream adapter channel-directory hook. Re-run the device scenario above on the deployed plugin to certify scheduled delivery, including the offline queue and opt-in gates.
- **FIX SHIPPED (2026-07-07) — installer + doctor guard against stale duplicate plugin copies; live-host verify pending.** Root cause of the 2026-06-29 round-trip failure: the gateway loader dedups discovered plugins by manifest `name`, so a second directory declaring `name: hermes-relay` (an old-installer backup copy, or a stray native install) could win the dedup and make the gateway load stale code — silently ignoring every later deploy. `plugin/doctor.py` now emits a `plugin-name-unique` warning when more than one directory under `~/.hermes/plugins/` declares the same plugin name (distinct real targets only — two links to the same target are deduped), and `install.sh` sweeps any such duplicate so only the canonical `hermes-relay` symlink survives. (Current `install.sh` already `rm -rf`s the old link rather than backing it up inside the plugins dir, so the original "back up outside the plugins dir" half is moot.) **Verify on the live host:** `hermes relay doctor` reports the `plugin-name-unique` check, and a reinstall leaves exactly one `hermes-relay` entry under `~/.hermes/plugins/`.

## Phone platform — usability roadmap (post device-verification, 2026-06-29)

**North-star (2026-06-29): the phone should replace Discord-on-the-phone for agent contact.** The agent lane is meant to be a place you live in — proactive messages land, you reply inline or open a real thread, you multitask in and out of it like a chat app. That framing (not "an inbox of notifications") drives every item below: it must feel like a first-class messaging surface, attributed as its own gateway lane, with the conversation persisted and continuable.

**Decision (2026-06-29): "separate lanes, unified surface."** The phone/agent conversation stays its own **gateway-platform lane** — distinct from the Standard Chat tab, which must keep working on vanilla upstream Hermes with no plugin — but is surfaced as a **first-class chat-style thread** that reuses the chat UI and sits alongside Chat. NOT a Chat "transport": a transport is an interchangeable pipe for the *same* user-chat conversation; the phone platform is a *different* conversation (agent-initiated, own session store/attribution, relay auth), so treating it as a transport miscategorizes it and couples a standard surface to a relay-only capability.

**Refinement (2026-06-29) — unified-session model: "Threads."** Going further on "unified surface": the agent conversation is **not a separate tab/segment** at all — it is a **source-tagged session inside the one Chat surface**, a **Thread** (`source=phone`). What makes a Thread special vs. a normal gateway chat are *session properties*, not a separate UI: (a) the agent can initiate, (b) relay `proactive` transport + relay-gated, (c) standing/named DM. **Scrollback = the gateway session store** (same read path Chat uses); **live receive = relay `proactive` push** (→ notification); **send = `proactive.reply`**. `ProactiveInboxStore` is demoted to a live-push cache + outbox (no parallel history). The Thread capability shows in the **best-path/capability UI** (relay tier, like terminal/bridge/voice) and as a clean **Threads** entry — thread-spool icon, NOT a phone glyph — pinned atop the session drawer when active; never a connection-wizard step. Degrades cleanly (no plugin → no `source=phone` sessions → Chat unchanged). **Supersedes the "separate Agent lane / 4th nav segment" sketch** and merges with the "source attribution in Chat" goal below. Keep the two "gateway" senses straight: *platform layer* (the Thread's `source`) ≠ *dashboard `/api/ws` transport* (how live bytes flow). Full re-cut: docs/decisions.md ADR 12.

- **Outbound buffering — ✅ relay-side + arrived-while-away receive UX DONE.** `ProactiveChannel.push()` queues agent→phone messages in a bounded deque (drop-oldest, 24 h TTL) when no phone is subscribed and returns `{queued: true}`. `_flush_outbound` delivers FIFO on the next subscribe (stale pruned), marks flushed messages, and sends one batch-complete count; Android labels those Thread bubbles “While away” and shows one accessible batch summary without changing unread behavior. Inspect/cancel remains available through `peek_outbound`/`cancel_outbound`, loopback `GET`/`DELETE /phone/outbound`, and desktop `relay queue`. **Remaining:** show the user's OWN pending replies (the Phase 3 reply queue) with an honest Queued/Cancel affordance; a dashboard queue view remains optional.
- **Threads surface (unified-session model — see ADR 12 + the Refinement above).** Build order, each shippable: **(1)** source tags in the session drawer (`source=phone` → clean **Threads** chip + thread-spool icon, NOT a phone glyph) — also delivers the "source attribution in Chat" goal; **(2)** open a Thread in Chat from its session-store history (reuse the existing message-history path); **(3)** route the live `proactive` push into the session view + notification + unread, demoting `ProactiveInboxStore` to cache/outbox; **(4)** reply from the Chat composer via `proactive.reply` + persist the user turn + local `Sending/Queued/Failed` status — **MVP**; **(5)** a **Threads capability row** in the best-path UI + a pinned **Threads** entry atop the drawer (thread-spool icon, shown only when relay-paired + opted-in) + retire `HermesInboxScreen`, re-point the notification deep-link + Settings "View messages"; **(6)** outbox/retry on reconnect; **(7)** relay `proactive.reply.ack` (honest Delivered) + `proactive.cancel`; **(8)** multi-thread `chat_id` (named/project Threads). **Verify gate before (1):** confirm the app's session-list/history path surfaces a `source=phone` session cleanly (upstream `session.list` returns all sources flat, so it should — but check whether the drawer currently filters it out). Honesty call: do NOT show "Delivered" until (7) lands (can't confirm it client-side before the ack).
  - **Status (2026-06-29, implemented UNBUILT — verify in Studio):** **CODE-COMPLETE on `dev`:** slice **1** (drawer source tags + `ThreadSpoolGlyph` + Threads filter), **2** (open a Thread from history — free via the existing `loadSessionHistory` path), **3-parse** (carry `reply_to` on `ProactiveMessage`), **4** (composer reply in a `source=phone` session routes over `proactive.reply`; `MessageDeliveryStatus` SENDING→DELIVERED/FAILED on the bubble), **5** (Threads capability row in `SessionPathCard` + `threadsCapabilityActive` drawer wiring), **7** (relay `proactive.reply.ack` + `proactive.cancel` — 25/25 `unittest` green — and client ack handling). **DONE since (2026-06-29, built + on phone):** live **in-thread reply rendering**; **user-created named Threads** ("+ New Thread"); **retire `HermesInboxScreen`**; relay slice-7 ack/cancel **DEPLOYED** to the host so **"Delivered" is live**. **DONE (2026-08-14):** notification taps survive cold start and open the exact `chat_id`; agent-initiated outbound messages appear as connection-scoped provisional Threads backed by the bounded proactive store, then promote to the real `source=phone` session after the first reply. **DEFERRED:** per-session **unread badge**; **outbox/retry** (needs multiplexer connection-state); **agent-initiated** named Threads (upstream `send_message` thread param). On-device verifies for the create-flow: fresh-`chat_id` auto-create, the `…:dm:<chat_id>` id form, `renameSession` on a phone session.
  - **User-created Threads (slice 8, Discord-style) — CODE-COMPLETE on `dev` (built + installed 2026-06-29; on-device behavior pending).** "+ New Thread" in the drawer's Threads view → name dialog → `ChatViewModel.startNewThread` mints a fresh `chat_id`; the first composer message opens it over `proactive.reply` (gateway auto-creates the `source=phone` session) → `switchToCreatedThread` polls + switches to the real session + applies the name. Existing-thread replies route by the `chat_id` parsed from the session id (`…:dm:<chat_id>`; opaque id → home fallback). **On-device verifies:** (1) a fresh-`chat_id` no-`reply_to` inbound creates a new `source=phone` session; (2) the phone session id carries the `…:dm:<chat_id>` form the client parses; (3) `renameSession` titles a phone session. **Remaining slice-8:** AGENT-initiated named Threads (the upstream `send_message` thread/chat_id param so the agent can open its own named Threads).
  - **`chat_id` not exposed by `/api/sessions` (root cause of the 2026-06-29 on-device create-flow bugs — fixed client-side).** Confirmed on the host: a phone session's `id` is a timestamp (e.g. `20260629_204755_94f391d6`); the real `chat_id` lives in the `session_key` (`agent:main:phone:dm:<chat_id>`) and a `chat_id` column — but `/api/sessions` returns **neither `chat_id` nor `session_key`**, only `source` + the timestamp `id`. So the client could not map a session ↔ its `chat_id`, which broke create-thread switch/rename + reply routing + in-thread injection. **Client workaround shipped:** find a created thread by session-list **diff** (the new `source=phone` session), keep an in-memory `sessionId → chat_id` map (learned at creation + from incoming `phone.message`s) for reply routing, and inject by source (+ learned chat_id) rather than a parsed id. **Limitation:** for a thread the app didn't create *this* session (agent-created, another device, or after an app restart) `chat_id` is unknown until a message arrives while viewing it → its replies fall back to the home channel until then. **RESOLVED via the plugin (2026-06-29, per upstream-or-plugin policy):** the relay now exposes `GET /phone/threads` (`plugin/relay/session_store.py` reads the gateway store read-only → `[{session_id, chat_id, title}]`; `server.py` `handle_phone_threads`, bearer for the app / loopback for diag; 5 unit tests). The app (`RelayHttpClient.fetchPhoneThreads` → `ConnectionViewModel.phoneThreadChatIds` on every `auth.ok` → `ChatViewModel.seedThreadChatIds`, authoritative over the learned map) now routes replies correctly for **any** Thread — incl. ones it didn't create + after restart. Deployed + verified live. **Still-nice-to-have (lower priority): the upstream PR** to add `chat_id`/`session_key` to `/api/sessions` (the standard-path proper fix; the relay route then becomes redundant + the client prefers upstream when present).
- **Threads as named/project conversations (Discord-parity — folds into multi-thread #8).** A stable *named* `chat_id` per project = a persistent, agent-reachable project Thread (Discord named-thread parity for "persist a session for a project"). Enables: the agent **opening** a new named Thread for a background job/topic (a relay/gateway "open thread" affordance + a `send_message`-adjacent tool); cron/job updates landing in their own Thread; and replying to a Thread from any surface (desktop CLI / dashboard) since it is just a gateway session. Also evaluate per-Thread profile binding (a project Thread uses the "work" profile — ties to profile=contact).
- **Thread vs. normal gateway chat — keep complementary, don't force one.** A Thread is a gateway chat + proactive delivery + `source` attribution. Use a *normal* gateway chat for live foreground interactive work (live `reasoning.delta` over `/api/ws`); use a *Thread* for persistent/named/agent-reachable/background-delivered conversations. Possible future enhancement (verify first): when a Thread is open in the foreground, allow a live `/api/ws prompt.submit` turn into that `source=phone` session for live reasoning — but confirm it does NOT break platform attribution or the proactive reply loop before relying on it; the proven send path stays `proactive.reply`.
  - **LOOK INTO (own item, owner-requested 2026-06-29): live `/api/ws` transport for a foregrounded Thread.** Goal: when a Thread is open in the app foreground, give it the *same* live experience as Chat (live `reasoning.delta` + tool-progress) by running the turn over the `/api/ws` dashboard-gateway transport into that `source=phone` session, instead of the notification-grade `proactive.reply` path. Spec the experiment: (1) does `session.resume` + `prompt.submit` on a `source=phone` session over `/api/ws` keep `source=phone` (not silently re-tag `tui`)? (2) does it bypass `PhoneAdapter` / the role_authorized reply loop, and does that matter when the user is the one typing? (3) reconcile the two send paths (foreground→`/api/ws`, background/notification→`proactive.reply`) without double-sends. If it holds, a Thread becomes "background-delivered like a DM, but live like Chat when you open it" — the best of both. Until verified, `proactive.reply` stays the only send path.
- **Docs/user-docs for Threads (lockstep — author with the user-facing slices 4–5).** Dev refs are done (ADR 12 carries the unified-session decision + the two-"gateway" split). Still to write when the surface ships: a plain-language `user-docs/features/threads.md` — what a Thread *is*, **Chat vs Threads** (live foreground work vs. persistent, agent-reachable conversations), the two opt-in gates, that it's relay-only — plus a **brief in-app explainer** (e.g. a one-line hint on the Threads filter empty state or a small info affordance, not a wall of text), and `docs/relay-protocol.md` + relay-server route docs for the wire. Replace the stale user-docs "Coming Soon → Push Notifications" row; keep it distinct from the clipboard inbox and the inbound Notification Companion.
- **More Threads fold-ins (capture now, build with the relevant slice).** (a) **Read-state back to the agent** — tell the gateway you saw a proactive message (Discord-style read receipt) so the agent knows; fold into the `proactive.reply.ack` design (#7). (b) **Cross-surface reply** — because a Thread is just a gateway session, a reply could come from the desktop CLI / dashboard too, not only the phone; near-free once unified, verify the reply routing. (c) **Priority/importance on a proactive message** — let the agent mark urgent vs FYI → notification importance / quiet-hours bypass; small payload field + maps to the notifier channel.
- **Agent-created per-thread `chat_id`.** User-created named Threads and arbitrary
  `chat_id` routing are shipped. Remaining: expose a `send_message`-adjacent
  agent affordance that can deliberately open/name a project Thread.
- **Queued message state.** Sending/Delivered/Failed bubbles and relay reply ACKs
  are shipped. Add an honest Queued state plus Cancel when the offline outbox
  exists; do not infer delivery from socket enqueue alone.
- **Auto-title the phone thread** like other sessions (first confirm whether the gateway already auto-titles platform sessions; wire it through if so).
### Discord/Telegram replacement — capability gaps (to fully retire reaching for them)

The gateway-platform model is the *correct + sufficient architecture* (the phone is a registered platform peer, so anything that routes to a platform — `send_message`, cron `deliver=`, channel directory, background jobs — can reach the phone). These are the concrete gaps between "architecturally a peer" and "I never open Discord":

- **Guaranteed background delivery (the biggest gap; no push today).** Delivery is **live-WSS-only** + a 24 h relay buffer; there is **no FCM/UnifiedPush** wake-up. If the app process is dead AND not holding a socket, a message waits for the next reconnect, and the relay buffer is ephemeral (lost on relay restart). Discord/Telegram feel instant because they wake the device via push even when the app is dead. Decide a **push transport**: **UnifiedPush/ntfy** (recommended — self-hostable, no Google dependency, upstream *already* ships an `ntfy` platform, on-brand for self-hosted) vs **FCM** (simplest UX but adds Play Services + a push relay; clashes with self-hosted ethos — at most the `googlePlay` flavor) vs **persistent foreground keep-alive service** holding the relay WSS (zero new infra, like `GatewayKeepAliveService`, but battery cost + Doze-fragile). Likely: UnifiedPush primary + foreground-keepalive fallback.
- **Cron / background-job delivery needs live certification.** The standalone sender and channel-directory enumeration are implemented; certify `deliver=phone` against a deployed Relay and paired device, including reconnect delivery from the bounded offline queue.
- **Agent-initiated multi-thread creation remains.** The app already renders N
  `source=phone` sessions, user-created Threads vary `chat_id`, and replies route
  by `chat_id` + `reply_to`. The missing parity is letting the agent open/name a
  distinct Thread for a topic or job.
- **Durable history / scrollback — SHIPPED.** Threads reopen through the gateway
  session store; the relay buffer is only the live/offline-delivery layer, not a
  parallel history database.
- **Profile = contact mapping (new idea, fold in).** Multiple Hermes **profiles** (distinct agent personas/configs) could each be a distinct thread *source*/"contact" — DMing different agents. Maps cleanly onto the per-thread `chat_id` + source-attribution work; lets the app feel like a contact list of agents.
- **Per-thread notification controls (Discord-parity affordances).** Exact-thread notification deep-linking is shipped. Remaining: per-thread notification channels and mute/DND/quiet-hours controls (Phase 3 partially).
- **Agent-initiated rich content.** Agent → phone thread with **images/cards** (relay media infra + `InboundAttachmentCard`/`HermesCardBubble` already exist on the chat side — reuse). Inbound (phone → agent) reply media stays deferred (text-first), but outbound rich content is low-cost parity.
- **In-thread "agent is working" indicator.** A typing/working state in the thread while the agent thinks/runs tools (Discord typing-dots parity) — the chat surface already has thinking indicators to reuse.

- **Source/platform attribution, filtering, and Thread-name persistence — SHIPPED.**
  The drawer and Chat settings show source badges and persisted visibility filters;
  `ThreadNameStore` persists user Thread names across restart and reapplies them to
  session rows. Remaining Threads work is the explicit residual list above
  (unread, outbox/retry, exact deep-link, agent-created named Threads, and live
  foreground `/api/ws`).
- **Threads Beta badges — SHIPPED.** The Threads filter and best-path capability
  row render the shared `BetaChip`. Removing Beta remains gated on live foreground
  `/api/ws`, per-session unread, upstream `chat_id` exposure, and outbox/retry.

## Voice — Standard-path parity follow-ups

- **On-device verification of the Server voice config card.** Static read + unit tests cover the client/merge logic, but the card's render, provider-scoped field switching, the ElevenLabs picker (key-present and `available:false`), and a live save round-trip against a real dashboard still need an on-device pass. Confirm a save reaches `config.yaml` and the next voice turn reflects it.
- **Generic Manage "Config" tab is still read-only.** This work added a *voice-scoped* editor; the Manage Config tab still renders `/api/config/schema` as two non-editable rows (`fields`, `category_order`). A full schema-driven editor for all categories (general/agent/terminal/…) grouped by `category_order`, GET-merge-PUT-whole, is a separate, larger task if we want full desktop Config parity.
- **`silenceThresholdMs` default change (3000 → 1250 ms) is user-facing.** Confirm on-device that 1.25 s end-of-speech doesn't clip slow speakers in real use, and that the new 12 s idle/no-speech auto-close (which now also applies to Tap-to-talk — previously "wait forever") feels right. Easy to revert the default if too aggressive.
- **Standard voice config targets the launch-profile config (`profile = null`).** Standard voice is host-global, so the editor writes the base `config.yaml`. If a user runs a non-default *launch* profile, revisit whether to scope the config write to the active profile (the dashboard `/api/config?profile=` supports it).
- **CLI `voice.*` config not surfaced.** The editor covers `tts.*`/`stt.*`; the separate `voice.*` block (record_key, beep_enabled, the CLI's own silence_threshold/duration) is intentionally out of scope — surface it only if a phone use-case appears.
## Chat UI refresh — follow-ups

- **`/font <name>` slash command (optional, deferred).** The chat-UX brief floated a chat slash command mirroring the Appearance Font picker. Deferred to keep the work inside the chat-UI/theme lane: it needs the command intercepted in the chat send path (`ChatViewModel`) before it forwards to the server, plus a `SlashCommand` palette entry. The settings picker is the primary, shipped surface. Add `/font` later as a thin wrapper over `ConnectionViewModel.setAppFont`, discoverable via the slash palette.
- **On-device verification of the chat refresh.** The Roborazzi harness proves layout + that Inter/Nunito load as distinct faces host-side, but the final typeface crispness and feel (avatar size, bubble width, density on a real Samsung) are a maintainer on-device gate. Confirm the variable-font weights (400/500/600/700) resolve on-device and Inter reads clean at body sizes.
- **Growing the font set.** The `AppFont` registry is open — add more OFL/Apache faces (e.g. a serif or a display mono) by dropping a TTF into `app/src/main/res/font` and adding one enum entry; keep the license text in `licenses/`.

## Crash-class follow-ups

- **Verify the Tink pin didn't break EncryptedSharedPreferences (owner, on-device).** The Android-15 `removeFirst`/`removeLast` crash lint flagged `com.google.crypto.tink.hybrid.HybridConfig.<clinit>` in the Tink dependency. Our app pulls Tink transitively via `androidx.security:security-crypto` for `SessionTokenStore`'s `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, which uses the AEAD path (not Hybrid), so the flagged `<clinit>` is very likely never reached at runtime — but we pinned `com.google.crypto.tink:tink-android:1.16.0` (ahead of security-crypto's transitive Tink) to clear the Play warning. **This is untestable without a build:** a too-new Tink can break `EncryptedSharedPreferences` at *runtime* (a `NoSuchMethodError`, not a compile error, so `./gradlew build` won't catch it). On-device smoke: launch the app, pair/sign in, force-stop + relaunch, and confirm the stored session survives (no re-pair prompt) and no startup crash. If it breaks, the blast radius is one line — revert the `tink-android` pin (catalog + `app/build.gradle.kts`) and the token store falls back to security-crypto's transitive Tink; then either try a lower Tink (1.15.0) or leave the (unreached) warning.
- **Bridge screenshots: regrant UX.** Multi-device live smoke found that a device can report `screen_capture_granted=false` because the MediaProjection grant was revoked and needs an in-app/user-consent regrant. The e-ink timeout path has been hardened with a longer configurable wait and one capture-pipeline rebuild retry; remaining polish is to surface the regrant action more prominently in Bridge status.

- **Audit remaining throwing URL-build sites for the "Invalid URL host" class (#131).** The #131 fix guarded the two clients that take a user-entered base URL on the Manage/voice path (`DashboardApiClient`, `StandardHermesVoiceClient`) and validates input at entry. Remaining site groups:
  - **`HermesApiClient` streaming methods — DONE 2026-07-08.** `sendChatStream` / `sendCompletionsStream` / `sendRunStream` now build via the non-throwing `authRequestOrNull()` chokepoint (backed by top-level `buildApiRequestOrNull`, unit-tested like `buildRelayRequestOrNull`); a malformed base URL fails the turn through the normal `onError` channel ("Invalid server address …") and returns an inert EventSource instead of throwing out of the ViewModel. The whole #131 audit list is now closed.
  - **`ConnectionManager` WSS connect — FIXED 2026-07-07** (this was the confirmed crasher: Play 1.2.6 on a Galaxy S25 Ultra / Android 16, `IllegalArgumentException` from `HttpUrl$Builder.parse` via `doConnectInternal` → `Request.Builder.url()` on the IO coroutine). Now routed through `buildRelayRequestOrNull()` → graceful Disconnected + diagnostic instead of a throw. `ConnectionManagerUrlGuardTest` covers it.
  - **Remaining relay HTTP clients — DONE 2026-07-07 (defense-in-depth).** `RelayVoiceClient` now validates its base in `resolveHttpBase()` (returns null on a malformed URL → the existing `Result.failure` guards fire), and `RelayHttpClient`'s two string-URL sites (`fetchMedia`, `listSessions`) use `toHttpUrlOrNull()` → `Result.failure`. `RelayProfileInspectorClient` was already fully guarded (every `.toHttpUrl()` wrapped in `catch (IllegalArgumentException)`). The whole #131 relay class is now covered; `HermesApiClient` streaming (the other lower-risk group above) remains the only open item.

## Session titles (#133) — follow-ups beyond the client fixes

### Session drawer audit follow-ups

- **Certify first-open latency against a large profile store.** Verify a cold
  launch, immediate drawer open, repeated close/open, and profile switches on a
  real high-row-count Dashboard. The first bounded page must not wait on
  Gateway socket readiness; cached rows must remain visible; a timeout must end
  without another long automatic read; and the final failure must be retryable
  **Unavailable**, never "No sessions." Capture both client timing and the
  server's session-list request duration before calling the path fixed.
- **Certify progressive paging on large stores.** Android loads 50 visible-source
  recents first and appends 50-row `offset` pages near the end of the drawer.
  Exercise repeated near-end triggers, a profile/route switch during page load,
  hidden-source preference changes, terminal short pages, and server search
  without regressing ownership, cached rows, pin/archive state, or compression
  tips.

The client-side mitigations shipped (see DEVLOG 2026-06-27): the `updateSessions` clobber guard, the post-turn title reconcile (gateway), and the subtle "not auto-named here" drawer note on SSE. These two are the larger follow-ups:

- **Upstream PR: auto-title on the api_server surface.** `APIServerAdapter._run_agent` (`gateway/platforms/api_server.py:3492`) calls `agent.run_conversation(...)` and returns without ever invoking `agent.title_generator.maybe_auto_title` — so `/api/sessions/*/chat[/stream]`, `/v1/runs`, and `/v1/chat/completions` never auto-name sessions (only the gateway/tui_gateway → cli.py path does). Mirror the gateway call site (`gateway/run.py:15493`): after a successful first exchange, fire `maybe_auto_title(self._ensure_session_db(), session_id, user_message, final_response, history, main_runtime={...})` in the existing thread-executor return path. Standard-path rule applies — it's an upstream contribution; our client degrades gracefully until it merges. This is the proper fix for the SSE-surface half of #133.

- **Relay-side patch (interim, until the upstream PR lands).** Because the phone's SSE chat hits the upstream api_server **directly** on `:8642` (not through the relay on `:8767`), the relay can't intercept the turn to title it inline. Options to evaluate:
  - A relay background reconciler that periodically scans the shared `state.db` for untitled sessions with ≥1 exchange and titles them via the same auxiliary-LLM logic (`agent.title_generator.generate_title`) — essentially running upstream's titler out-of-band. Lowest client impact, but couples the relay to the session DB schema.
  - A relay `/sessions/{id}/title` helper the client can POST after an SSE turn to request server-side generation, keeping the LLM call (and key) server-side. More explicit, needs a client call.
  - Decision gate: prefer the upstream PR; only ship a relay patch if upstream review stalls. Keep it behind the relay (never the Vanilla Hermes path).

- **(Separate feature — DROPPED 2026-06-27) Client-side title generation via the main LLM.** Idea: when a session still lacks a server title after its first turn, have the app ask the main model for a 3–7-word title and persist it via `renameSession`. **Dropped because there is no client-reachable LLM endpoint that doesn't persist a session** — which would put phantom title-generation sessions in the drawer/history (the explicit no-go):
  - `/v1/chat/completions`: when no `X-Hermes-Session-Id` is sent, the server *derives* a session_id from the prompt fingerprint (`_derive_chat_session_id`) and `_create_agent` runs with `session_db=_ensure_session_db()` → the turn persists. 1 user + 1 assistant msg passes the drawer's `min_messages=1` filter → phantom row.
  - `/v1/responses` with `store:false`: `store` only governs the in-memory response-chaining store; `session_id = stored_session_id or uuid4()` is still passed to `_run_agent`, so it *also* persists a session row.
  - Reusing the chat's own session id would append the title prompt/response to the real conversation history — worse.
  - Why upstream is clean: `agent/title_generator.py` calls `auxiliary_client.call_llm` directly (raw provider call with the server's keys, no session machinery). The phone has neither provider keys nor a non-persisting endpoint, so it can't replicate that.
  - **Correct home = server-side** (the upstream api_server titler PR above, or the relay-side titler). A create-then-delete hack on the client (read `X-Hermes-Session-Id`, then `DELETE`) is fragile/racy and still flashes a row — not worth it. Revisit only if upstream ever exposes a non-persisting utility-completion endpoint.

- [x] **Session rename now profile-scoped on the gateway (fixed 2026-06-27).** Added `DashboardApiClient.renameSession`/`patchJsonObject` + `ConnectionViewModel.renameProfileScopedSession` + `ChatViewModel.profileSessionRenamer` (wired in `RelayApp`); `renameSession` routes through it when `streamingEndpoint == "gateway"`, falling back to the unscoped api_server PATCH otherwise. Verify on-device: rename a session on a non-default profile and confirm the title survives a drawer refresh / app restart.
  - **Profile-scoping audit result (2026-06-27):** rename was the *only* remaining gap. List (`profileSessionLister`), messages (`profileMessageLoader`), and delete (`profileSessionDeleter`) are already scoped; create on the gateway goes through `session.create` over `/api/ws` (inherently profile-correct); the SSE create-path auto-title PATCH (`ChatViewModel:2692`) targets the shared api_server DB where there are no profiles, so unscoped is correct; `/branch` is a server-side slash command. No further client-side session ops bypass profile scoping.

## User-Added:

- [ ] Verify profile selection retains voice config selections in all voice modes/configuration combinations - enhance UI/configurability/management for this.

### Thinking indicator — post-v1.3.0 follow-ups

The animated dot-matrix "thinking" indicator shipped in **android-v1.3.0**
(Wave/Pulse/Bounce/Sparkle motions + Auto/accent colors, live preview in Chat
settings). The 1.4.1 path also honors app animation settings, OS animator scale,
and TalkBack touch exploration. Remaining:

- **Optional: promote to a full avatar style** — the alternative scope (a `DotMatrixAvatar` `AgentAvatar` shown everywhere via `LocalAvailableAvatars`, selected in Appearance). Deferred in favor of the narrower in-bubble indicator.

## Demo mode (2026-06-27) — deferred polish

Shipped offline Demo / Explore mode (see DEVLOG 2026-06-27). Core is in; these are non-blocking polish items, none required for the Play "App access" fix:

- **On-device verify (Studio).** Confirm: "Try the demo" on the onboarding Connect page and the standalone Connect screen lands on Chat showing the canned transcript (Markdown, tool-progress card, weather card, code block); the persistent banner shows and its Connect exits demo into the real wizard; demo runs in airplane mode with no network; the Chat mic explains locally that Voice needs a connection and never attempts transcription; Manage/Voice show the demo empty state; Bridge/Terminal show their pair-gate; backing out of demo Chat clears the flag so a real connection still works.
- **Demo composer is a silent no-op — DONE 2026-07-08.** `sendMessage` now intercepts while `isDemoMode`: echoes the user bubble and appends `DemoContent.composerReply` ("offline demo, can't answer for real — tap Connect in the banner"), both clientOnly so demo-exit's `clearMessages()` wipes them. Wired via `setDemoModeWiring` (unconditional in RelayApp — the client-gated chat init never runs in demo, so ChatViewModel's own handler is null there). On-device check rides the existing demo verify item above.
- **Light typewriter/stream simulation.** The transcript is statically populated; an optional per-token reveal on first entry would better convey the "streaming" feel. Acceptable as static for v1.
- **Optional richer demo.** Could add a second tool type or an image attachment to the transcript to showcase more surfaces; kept minimal/one-file for now.

## Orchestration batch (2026-06-22) — deferred follow-ups

Four User-Added items resolved via a 4-worker orchestration pass (disjoint file ownership, coordinator-serialized commits): clean-chat viewport (`1dca285`), connections reframe (`c9fa8f7`), diagnostics/analytics (`c3098a9`), session-delete fix (`6552566`). Plus a follow-on profile-isolation fix raised mid-session: cold-start session-drawer hydration (`889273a`). **Committed to `dev`, NOT built/linted/verified.** Remaining:

- **Build + lint + on-device verify all five (Studio).** Run `./gradlew lint` and a Studio build before pushing `dev` (workers couldn't run gradle). Then confirm on device: clean-chat shows a noticeably taller text area that scrolls; deleting a session on a *non-default* profile sticks (no resurrection after the drawer re-fetches); the Diagnostics screen renders honest per-check status + failure reasons and opens detail on a failing tappable row; connections/voice/permissions copy reads "Hermes"/"Relay"; **and on a cold start while a non-default profile is selected, the session drawer loads that profile's sessions directly with no flash of the server-default list.**
- **Profile isolation — broader sweep (cold-start race).** The session drawer + restored session context are now gated on `ProfileController.selectionSettled` (`889273a`), so they no longer load the server-default profile before the persisted profile resolves. Other profile-scoped surfaces read the *live* `selectedProfile.value` and self-correct when it resolves but aren't gated: voice prefs (`VoiceViewModel.onProfileChanged` at the `RelayApp` voice effect), `profileDisplayAlias`, `profileIcon`. They re-seed on resolution (no visible content-flash like the drawer), but if any shows a wrong-profile beat on cold start, gate its first use on `profileSelectionSettled` the same way. Also: `selectionSettled`'s decision logic is unit-testable (pure over connId/selected/pending/profiles) — add a `ProfileControllerSettledTest` when convenient.
- **Diagnostics: no live re-probe trigger.** The status checks reflect the *last* probe state (read-only snapshot). A "Re-run checks" button would need `ConnectionViewModel` to expose probe methods — deferred so the diagnostics work didn't have to edit a concurrently-owned VM.
- **Diagnostics: Pass checks lack a last-checked timestamp/duration.** `StatusCheck` carries `timestampMs`/`durationMs`, but the VM doesn't expose probe timing, so passing rows show no "checked Ns ago". Wire when/if the VM surfaces probe timestamps.
- **Connections reframe — out-of-scope occurrences left intentionally.** `ConnectionViewModel.kt`, `VoiceAudioClient.kt`, `VoiceViewModel.kt`, `BridgeCoreScreen.kt`, and `RelayApp.kt` still contain "Standard"/"Vanilla" in code identifiers/log strings; only user-facing display copy was reframed. Revisit if any of those surface to users.

## Orchestration batch (2026-06-21) — deferred follow-ups

Client-side profile-lock + voice fixes (the items marked above) landed via a planning→implementation orchestration pass, **built + deployed to device as 1.2.1 (versionCode 15)**; new unit suite green (36 Kotlin + 11 Python). On-device behaviour verification still pending. Remaining from that batch:

- **Realtime voice: server-side half (Python) — DONE + DEPLOYED 2026-06-21.** `plugin/relay/realtime_agent/broker.py`: `_send_hermes_run_progress` now heartbeats while `session.hermes_task` is unfinished (helper `_should_continue_heartbeat`), closing the 90s stall at the source; spoken-status repeat raised 30s→90s and gated on a *coarse* status change (`_coarse_spoken_status_key` / `_should_repeat_spoken_status`) so tool-message churn no longer re-narrates. `plugin/tests/test_realtime_heartbeat.py` 11/11; `test_realtime_promotion` regression 5/5. Deployed: committed `d1820fb` → pushed to `origin/dev` → server `~/.hermes/hermes-relay` fast-forwarded + `hermes-relay` restarted (active, clean startup) — both client + server halves now live end-to-end (re-pair the phone after the relay restart). Optional follow-up: flip `promotion_enabled` default to True so long runs detach.
- **Voice override on the streaming path (open question).** The `.route`→`.effectiveRoute` fix makes 'auto'+relay engage the override-capable path, but the streaming `/voice/output` renderer reads the relay's server-saved `voice_output:` config, not the UI `enhancedVoice` override. Decide whether the override card should also push to `updateVoiceOutputConfig`, or whether an override should force the basic `/voice/synthesize` path.
- **Per-profile voice on Standard (upstream).** `/api/audio/*` is host-global/text-only; the Standard surface still can't carry a per-request voice. Needs the upstream profile-voice / `/v1/audio/*` PR. Until then the client prefers the relay path; consider surfacing an honest "override needs Relay" state when Standard is the effective surface.
- **Profile lock: ChatScreen glyph + export.** The optional lock glyph on the chat-header avatar was skipped (`ChatScreen.kt` is owned by a concurrent session). Decide whether the per-connection lock belongs in settings export/import (it rides the `profile_selections` DataStore).
- **Unit tests — DONE 2026-06-21 (36/36 pass via `:app:testSideloadDebugUnitTest`).** `ProfileLockStoreTest` (9 — uses an in-memory `DataStore` harness; the file-backed factory hits a Windows write-rename/instance race), `ProfileControllerLockTest` (8, Robolectric), `CoerceAudioRouteTest` (7), `VoiceStatusGatesTest` (12).
- **On-device verification.** Override applies in 'auto'+relay; realtime survives a &gt;90s background task without stalling and stops over-narrating; Speaking waveform unfolds at first audible frame; profile lock hides pickers + holds on a missing profile; overlay shows the profile icon.

## Hands-free agentic voice backlog

Goal: make Hermes usable for hands-free work without leaving the operator blind

to tool state, safety prompts, or the current task.

- **Waveform output-start sync — SHIPPED; on-device confirmation remains.**
  Realtime output now gates on `RealtimePcmPlayer` playback-head movement or
  playback-synchronized amplitude through `shouldMarkRealtimeOutputActive`,
  matching the basic-TTS path. Confirm visually on-device with the 1.4.1 batch.

- **Voice command layer — upstream stop phrases and phase-aware pause are
  code-complete; live verify and navigation residuals remain.** Exact final transcripts can end the active voice chat,
  explicitly cancel the active background task, pause/resume Continuous mode,
  repeat a settled background answer, and start a new Standard chat. Bare
  `stop` is configurable and exact-only while voice chat is active; bare
  `pause` remains phase-gated to Continuous mode. `cancel`, partial transcripts,
  and command-like ordinary prompts stay on the normal Hermes route. Realtime
  `new chat` remains gated on a clean websocket
  session-rebind boundary; `open overlay` and `return to Hermes` remain future
  navigation commands. Verify barge-in Stop, pause during a background run, local
  command Chat cleanup, and Continuous rearm on device.

- **Spoken tool progress — baseline shipped; broader hands-free policy remains.**
  Realtime background runs already emit milestone speech plus coarse, low-noise
  progress with repeat suppression. The 1.4.1 residual is a unified policy across
  Voice engines and presets, not another parallel heartbeat implementation.

- **Realtime tool timeline parity** — the voice overlay should render the same

live thinking blocks, streaming assistant text, and tool call progress as the

normal chat surface without requiring exit/reload.

- **Hands-free confirmation flow** — risky actions need first-class spoken and

visual confirmation: "yes", "no", "cancel", "confirm", plus a visible and

audible countdown for destructive actions.

- **Voice session memory/status** — add a compact "where are we?" summary for

the current voice task: active objective, last tool result, pending next step,

and whether the agent is waiting on the user.

- **Mode presets — CODE-COMPLETE for 1.4.1; live apply/Custom-state verification
  remains.** Hands-free, Low latency, Careful tools, and Quiet/visual-only compose
  existing interaction and relay-promotion controls. They preserve engine, route,
  provider, model, voice, credentials, concurrency, and Hands-free's existing
  experimental barge-in choice. Relay update is server-first; local Voice/barge-in
  values share one DataStore transaction, with relay rollback on local failure.

- **Barge-in hardening — code complete; on-device matrix remains.** Full-turn
  listener ownership, AEC/noise suppression, upstream-compatible RMS
  calibration and thresholds, configurable playback grace, duck/cut behavior,
  late-delta fencing, next-turn interruption context, and single-microphone
  handoff are implemented. Phone testing still needs to cover speakerphone/headphones, quiet/noisy rooms, Standard/Realtime
  generation and playback, stop/pause, and resume-after-interruption.

- **Experimental wake word — on-device validation.** Verify first-enable model
  installation and integrity failure recovery, all supported ABIs, Android
  notification/microphone permission variants, background-start restrictions,
  task recreation from the detection notification, acoustic false-positive and
  false-negative rates, battery impact, stop action, and wake→voice→wake
  microphone handoff. Voice settings now provide a bounded real-microphone/model
  test with an input meter; use it to distinguish audio capture from KWS tuning
  before testing the full activation flow. The first release remains fixed to
  “Hey Hermes”; do not
  expose profile-specific phrases until routing and acoustic behavior are
  implemented and validated.

- **Android Digital Assistant — on-device validation.** On a physical device,
  select and remove Hermes through the system Assistant role; verify gesture,
  power-button, screen-off, credential-lock, and unlocked “Hey Hermes”
  invocation; confirm the system session appears without overlay/full-screen
  permissions; exercise compact, expanded, collapsed, and full-Voice handoff
  states, background tap-through, rotation and insets, cancel/back, microphone
  denial, network failure, process kill/recreation, and wake→voice→wake
  resumption. For background and keyguard capture, record `AudioRecord`, AppOps,
  and foreground-service state: the user-installed app owns capture outside the
  separate session process, so confirm whether the selected Assistant role is
  sufficient on each target OS or whether activation needs an explicit,
  activation-scoped microphone foreground-service lease. Measure idle battery
  drain because third-party assistants do not
  receive Google's dedicated low-power hotword hardware.

- **Audio quality guardrails** — normalize output volume across realtime and

fallback TTS providers, keep pronunciation hints/profile voice tuning, and

measure provider-specific delay, chunk gaps, and tail clipping.

- **Pluggable Realtime Agent media transports** — add an OpenAI-first WebRTC

transport option for Realtime Agent so mobile audio can use provider-native

jitter buffering, interruption, and media handling instead of only relay

WebSocket PCM. Design this as a provider transport interface

(`websocket`, `webrtc`, future `livekit`/SIP-style bridges) so other

realtime providers can opt in without forking the Hermes broker/tool

contract. Hermes must still own tools, memory, confirmations, current data,

and durable transcript state.

- **Voice engine selector** — implemented as an opt-in experimental Realtime

Agent engine in `docs/plans/2026-05-19-realtime-hermes-voice-agent.md`.

Follow-up work is provider-native turn-taking, richer confirmation handling,

and quality/latency evaluation before promotion beyond Experimental.

- **Realtime-native Hermes bridge prototype** — first relay-brokered slice

implemented in `docs/plans/2026-05-19-realtime-hermes-voice-agent.md`.

Remaining work: let OpenAI/xAI realtime sessions own more of the live speech

turn while still proxying every tool, confirmation, memory, and Android bridge

action through Hermes/relay safety.

## Research / open questions

### Proper Hermes plugin / skill / tool distribution

**Status:** open question, no plan yet.

We currently distribute Hermes-Relay via a one-shot `install.sh` that clones the repo, `pip install -e`s the package into the user's hermes-agent venv, and registers `skills/` via the `external_dirs` config knob. This works but it's a custom protocol — every project that wants to ship a Hermes plugin reinvents it.

Things to look into:

- **Does upstream hermes-agent have or plan a canonical plugin registry / package format?** If yes, we should migrate to it. If no, we may want to propose one upstream so third-party plugins (ours and others) get a standard install path.
- **Skill distribution as separate from plugin distribution** — right now skills ride along with the plugin install via `external_dirs`. Should skills be installable independently (e.g. `hermes skill install <git-url>`)? Would that fragment maintenance or improve reuse?
- **Tool registration discoverability** — `android_*` tools register at gateway import time. There's no canonical "list installed plugin tools" API. Would adding one to upstream make sense, or is `gateway tool list` already enough?
- **Versioning + compatibility ranges** — `pip install -e` doesn't enforce version pins between hermes-agent and our plugin. A breaking change in upstream's plugin loader could silently break us. Do we need a `hermes_compat: ">=0.8.0,<1.0.0"` field somewhere?
- **Update discovery (shipped 2026-06-30 — CLI + dashboard + app).** `hermes relay update-check`, a dashboard "Plugin version" card, and an app **About → "Relay"** row all compare the installed plugin against the latest `plugin-v*` release and surface the right update command (`hermes plugins update hermes-relay` vs `hermes-relay-update`). The app polls the relay's `GET /relay/update-check` (`:8767`, bearer) on each `auth.ok`; the relay is the single source of truth (the app never hits GitHub). Possible polish (deferred): a more prominent dismissible "relay is behind" banner outside About (today it's capability-first + the About row), and showing the app's own version alongside the relay's in the same readout (the app-Version row already exists separately just above it).
- **Per-profile enablement (shipped 2026-06-30).** `hermes relay profiles list|enable [--all|NAME]` + `plugin/profiles.py` resolve the install-once/enable-per-profile papercut; docs now cover the pair-once/one-relay model. Possible follow-up: an `install.sh` / `hermes plugins install` prompt offering "enable for all existing profiles" so new installs don't need the manual `profiles enable --all`.
- `**hermes-relay-self-setup` SKILL.md as a precedent** — we just shipped a self-installing skill that an LLM can fetch from a raw GitHub URL and execute. Does this pattern generalize? Could it become a recommended way for any third-party Hermes project to ship setup automation?
- **Bootstrap injection** — `hermes_relay_bootstrap/` monkey-patches `aiohttp.web.Application` to inject endpoints into vanilla/partial upstream. This is intentional but feels like a hack. The original broad PR #8556 was **closed as superseded**; native upstream now covers sessions/chat/fork via [#33134](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/33134) and skill/toolset discovery via `/v1/skills` + `/v1/toolsets` (#33016). **Done (2026-07-08, HRUI-002):** the bootstrap's sessions CRUD/messages/fork handlers and the legacy `GET /api/skills` list were retired outright — no pre-#33134 fallback remains; old core builds degrade via the client capability probe. **Done (2026-07-19, HRUI-004/012):** retained session search now uses upstream `AsyncSessionDB` when available and `asyncio.to_thread` on older Hermes, and every compatibility memory mutation resets the upstream consolidation-failure budget when that API exists. **Still gapped (bootstrap remains for these):** config, memory, legacy `/api/skills/{name}` detail + `PUT /api/skills/toggle` (501 stub), available-models, `/api/sessions/search`, and the slash-command middleware — each retires individually when a native replacement lands or the dependent UX is removed. Track upstream per surface.
- **Gateway slash-command preprocessor — upstream Stage 1 PR.** Sibling follow-up to the native session-control baseline (#33134). Intercepts known gateway commands on `/v1/runs` + `/v1/chat/completions`, dispatches the stateless ones (`/help`, `/commands`) via `gateway_help_lines()`, returns a deterministic "use a channel with session state" notice for the stateful majority. Currently being prepared in `C:/Users/Bailey/Desktop/Open-Projects/hermes-agent-pr-prep/` on branch `feat/api-server-gateway-commands`; awaiting subagent's code + draft PR body before pushing. See `docs/upstream-contributions.md` §5.
- **Gateway slash-command preprocessor — bootstrap middleware (Stage 1 equivalent).** Sibling shim in `hermes_relay_bootstrap/_command_middleware.py` that mirrors the upstream Stage 1 PR as an aiohttp middleware injected at bootstrap time. Ships the hallucination fix to vanilla-upstream installs before the upstream PR lands. Planned for v0.4.1, after the current bridge feature branch wraps. See `ROADMAP.md` v0.4.1 entry.
- **Stage 2 — stateful slash-command dispatch on `/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream`.** Unblocked now that session primitives shipped upstream (#33134 / `f7527b0`). Add a preprocessor scoped to the session chat stream endpoint only, using `session_id` as the persistence handle. Separate upstream PR + matching bootstrap middleware. See `docs/upstream-contributions.md` §5 ("Stage 2").

When the answer becomes clearer, this section becomes either an ADR in `docs/decisions.md` or a Plan under `Plans/`.

## Smaller deferred items

- **Certify the preferred CUA Driver backend (ADR 56).** The canonical-runtime
  probe, bounded adapter, server-owned control-session envelope, per-session
  grant state, local engine/status controls, telemetry-off process environment,
  and Hermes snapshot-token primitives now exist. Before graduating the engine,
  finish end-to-end enforcement of app/display/folder scopes and sensitive
  pixel/accessibility denial or redaction, harden the grant-bridge ACL and nonce
  lifecycle, and complete live Windows certification proving the physical cursor and
  foreground app stay unchanged, stale or cross-window tokens fail, two remote
  control sessions receive isolated animated cursors, and foreground escalation
  never happens implicitly. Exercise revoke on grant expiry, disconnect,
  re-pair, policy downgrade, emergency stop, Windows-session change, and daemon
  shutdown. The explicit local CUA install/update surface now verifies upstream
  manifest identity and installer SHA-256; add Windows publisher verification
  when upstream signs the installer. Keep raw CUA tools, configuration,
  recording, replay, and JavaScript outside the remote agent surface.
  Remove the temporary Windows readiness/health split once
  [trycua/cua#3103](https://github.com/trycua/cua/issues/3103) ships in the
  supported CUA range; restore a mandatory health gate only if the upstream
  probe is bounded and cannot leave UI Automation falsely busy.
- **MediaProjection consent flow** — wired in MainActivity (2026-04-12), needs end-to-end test on a real device
- **WorkManager upgrade for timed screen-access expiry notification** — authority already fails closed from persisted absolute expiry after restart; the prompt notification is currently a coroutine `Job + delay()` coordinated by `BridgeSafetyManager` / `AutoDisableWorker`. Upgrade only if background notification timing becomes important after androidx.work joins the classpath.
- **Wave 3 voice-bridge multi-turn confirmation** — currently a 5s TTS countdown with cancel; conversational confirmation is the follow-up
- **LLM client wiring for `android_navigate`** — `_default_vision_model` is stubbed; production swap to a real Anthropic/OpenAI vision client
- **Real screenshots of each flavor's a11y permission dialog** — for `user-docs/guide/release-tracks.md`
- `**llms.txt` standard** — explicitly skipped in favor of the `hermes-relay-self-setup` SKILL.md path; revisit if the standard gains traction in the agent ecosystem
- `**markdown-renderer`/`lifecycle` compileSdk ceiling — RESOLVED via compileSdk 37 (2026-06-22).** `MarkdownContent.kt` is on the 0.4x API, and `markdown-renderer 0.42.0` / `lifecycle 2.11.0` (the Dependabot bumps) require `compileSdk 37`. The project moved to **compileSdk 37** (`206d182`, across app/quest/relay-core/relay-ui; `targetSdk` stays 35), which satisfies them — so the temporary 1.2.2-prep pins (0.41.0 / 2.10.0 on compileSdk 36) were dropped when integrating `origin/dev`. Docs/refs reconciled to 37 (2026-06-23): CLAUDE.md, `docs/spec.md`, and the `android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk` flags in `gradle.properties` + `quest/gradle.properties`. A Dependabot ignore rule is still worth adding so a future bump that raises the compileSdk floor again fails loudly rather than silently (see next item).
- **Dependabot auto-merge guardrails** — Dependabot merged breaking bumps despite CI failing. Investigate why `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` isn't gating on CI status, and consider adding an ignore rule for packages we know need manual attention on major bumps (`markdown-renderer`, compose BOM, activity-compose).

## Crash reporting + foldable hardening (shipped 2026-06-20)

Triggered by a Play Store review: app "keeps crashing" during setup on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 (Android 16 / SDK 36, version code 13). Shipped: in-app crash capture (`util/CrashReporter.kt` — uncaught handler that persists a report then re-raises so Play vitals still collects; `ui/components/CrashReportDialog.kt` — show-once dialog with Copy + pre-filled GitHub-issue "Report"); QR camera-init hardening (`QrPairingScanner.kt` — try/catch around `ProcessCameraProvider.get()` and `InputImage.fromMediaImage()`, graceful `CameraUnavailableCard` → manual pairing instead of force-close).

Follow-ups:

- **Confirm the actual crash from Play vitals.** Pull the top crash cluster for Galaxy Z Fold7 / version code 13 (Quality → Android vitals → Crashes &amp; ANRs) to verify the camera path is the real cause vs. another setup-path throw. The hardening is correct regardless, but the trace closes the loop.
- **Portrait lock is moot on large screens under SDK 36.** `android:screenOrientation="portrait"` is largely ignored by Android 16's mandatory large-screen orientation override on foldables/tablets. Decide whether to keep the lock (it still applies on phones) or make it conditional; either way it does not *cause* the crash.
- **Foldable camera lifecycle races (from the 2026-06-20 audit, not yet fixed).** `QrPairingScanner` can still hit bind/unbind races on rapid fold/unfold recomposition (the `DisposableEffect` `unbindAll()` vs. an in-flight `addListener` bind), and `mapBoxToViewport` runs on possibly-stale `viewportSizePx` during a fold transition. Not crash-fatal after the try/catch hardening (logged + skipped), but worth a fold-aware guard if foldable adoption grows.
- **Optional: surface crash history in Settings.** The reporter keeps only the most recent crash (`files/crash/last-crash.json`, consumed on view). If repeat-crash diagnosis becomes common, keep a small ring of recent reports + a Settings entry to view/copy them.

## Relay enhancement layer + agent-context injection (shipped 2026-06-20 — `docs/plans/2026-06-20-relay-enhancement-layer.md`)

Shipped: `plugin/enhancements/` (registry + fail-open `context_injection` wrap of `AIAgent._build_system_prompt`), the `media-sensitivity` block, `GET /context/injected` audit route, dashboard toggles, client sensitivity re-thread + "Relay context (server-side)" audit section, and the transport-path UI (`ChatTransportStatusBadge` / `RelayStatusStrip` + tier ladder). OFF by default, removable, vanilla-safe.

Follow-ups:

- **Confirm the `AIAgent` seam on the live host before relying on it.** `context_injection._resolve_ai_agent_class()` tries `agent.system_prompt` / `run_agent`. When you flip `RELAY_AGENT_CONTEXT_ENABLED=1`, verify `GET /context/injected` shows the block AND that it actually lands in the prompt (the wrap is fail-open, so a wrong module = inert, not broken). If the class lives elsewhere, widen the module list.
- **Retire the monkey-patch when upstream adds a plugin context hook.** Drop `context_injection` (and migrate to the native hook) the moment hermes-agent ships a first-class system-prompt contributor — same as we retire bootstrap routes for native upstream routes.
- **Incremental bootstrap migration.** Fold the existing `hermes_relay_bootstrap` route-patches into `plugin/enhancements/` per-surface (startup phase) so patching is one surface; don't big-bang the working compat.
- **Structured media channel** — `docs/plans/2026-06-20-structured-media-channel.md` (design only). Replace fragile `MEDIA:`/markdown text markers with a structured channel carrying `sensitive` natively; lead with a relay `relay_send_media(path, sensitive, …)` tool.
- **Gateway voice-ephemeral via the same slot.** The enhancement layer's server-side injection can carry per-turn voice instructions on the gateway (which has no ephemeral `system_message`), letting voice stay on the gateway instead of being forced to SSE. Wire when the voice path is revisited.

---

## Attachments (shipped 2026-06-18 — `docs/plans/2026-06-18-attachment-experience.md`)

- **Collapsible message groups (shipped 2026-07-25).** Android wraps rendered galleries and generic/LOADING/FAILED cards in a localized, accessible attachment disclosure. It defaults open, remembers the user's fold state by stable message identity, and leaves a compact count/name/type summary available to restore all attachment actions.
- **B3 — download progress + cancel.** Inbound fetch is un-cancelable; the previews work scaffolded an indeterminate bar + nullable `onCancel`. Live wiring needs the fetch-path owner (`ChatViewModel`/`Attachment`) to expose determinate progress (Content-Length) + a cancel hook.
- **C5 — agent-side sensitivity config gate.** `RELAY_MEDIA_SENSITIVITY_HINTS` (env or per-profile) instructing the agent to annotate sensitive media via the prompt-builder. Transport (relay `X-Media-Sensitive` header + client blur) already ships; the agent isn't asked to set the bit yet.
- **Relay thumbnails (D6).** Server-side thumbnail generation to avoid full-size download for cards/galleries. Needs an image lib (Pillow not currently a dep) — evaluate before adding.
- **D5 — outbound upload progress.** No per-attachment progress during the 60s gateway PDF-render window.

## Voice overhaul (shipped 2026-06-18 — `docs/plans/2026-06-18-voice-overhaul.md`)

- **Per-profile voice on Standard (upstream PR).** Upstream `/api/profiles/*` has no voice field and `/api/audio/*` is host-global. Long-term: PR a voice section to the profile config + make `/api/audio/*` honor the active/`?profile=` profile. The relay path already carries per-profile voice; ship that first.

## Chat clean-mode + pets (shipped 2026-06-18 — `docs/plans/2026-06-18-chat-clean-mode-and-pets.md`)

- **Part-A chat polish residuals.** Per-code-block copy, horizontal scroll, the
  visible copy affordance, and mid-stream stall feedback are shipped. Remaining:
  profile/skill-aware empty-state chips and the ~40-flow recomposition hotspot at
  the top of `ChatScreen`.
- **Pet hot-load + in-app add/remove (shipped 2026-06-20).** Pets now live-refresh: an `avatarsRefreshTick` keys the avatar `produceState` in `RelayApp`, and Appearance re-scans `pets/` on open and after in-app import/delete — no app restart. Appearance gained "Add a pet" (SAF `.zip` import via `PetImporter`, zip-slip/zip-bomb guarded + validated through `toAvatar`) and an "Installed pets" list with per-pet remove (`PetLoader.deletePet`, confirm dialog, Sphere fallback). Remaining:
  - **Sphere-skin parity (shipped 2026-08-09).** Appearance now imports a bounded, validated declarative `.json` skin through the system picker, hot-refreshes the shared sphere registry, and selects the imported skin without an app restart.
  - `**adb push` into `Android/data` hangs on Samsung scoped storage.** Confirmed: pushing a pet pack to `/sdcard/Android/data/<pkg>/files/pets/` stalls (no bytes written) although `adb shell ls` of the dir works. In-app `.zip` import is the supported path; `/sdcard/Download` pushes fine. Consider softening `docs/pet-spec.md` + user-docs to lead with in-app import over adb.
  - **On-device import/delete smoke.** Import `/sdcard/Download/lucy.zip` via Add a pet → confirm Lucy appears, selects, and animates all states; then remove it and confirm the avatar falls back to the Sphere.
- **Pet behavior model — richer state association (spec'd 2026-06-19, `docs/pet-spec.md` "Agent states &amp; pet behavior").** Shipped: the honesty clamp (declared reactivity ∩ `PET_RENDERER_CAPABILITIES`), the friendly `writing` alias, the `**working`/tool-use overlay** (pet-local sub-state from `toolCallBurst`; opt-in `working` clip drives both the swap and the Tools badge), the **one-shot reaction layer** (`greet`/`wake` on appear, `done`/`celebrate` on turn-finish — opt-in, play-once-then-revert, transition-derived; `ONE_SHOT_MAX_MS` backstop), and `**intensity` modulation** (opt-in `reactive.intensity` → live playback speedup ≤1.6× via `rememberUpdatedState`; un-clamps the Activity badge). Voice · Tools · Activity reactivity is now complete. Remaining:
  - `**attention` one-shot (only deferred behavior).** A reaction on notification arrival — needs a host event the avatar doesn't yet receive (unlike `greet`/`done`, which ride state transitions). Would plumb a notification edge into `AvatarRenderState` (or a side channel) + a `PetOneShot.Attention`. Low priority: the avatar is rarely on-screen when notifications land (backgrounded) — see the value analysis; revisit only if the avatar becomes an always-on surface (persistent overlay / Quest port).
  - **On-device verification (working + one-shots + intensity).** Use the normal Chat background visualization, which receives `toolCallBurst`, `streamingIntensity`, and state transitions. Confirm: a `working` clip swaps in during a tool run and releases ~600ms after (`WORKING_BURST_THRESHOLD` 0.5); a `done` clip plays once on reply completion then returns to idle; a `greet` clip plays once when the avatar appears; with `intensity:true`, a writing/working loop visibly quickens while streaming. Confirm each decoded clip swap holds the previous complete visual until the new state is ready.
- **Undecodable-but-present image appears valid (audit 2026-06-19).** A file that exists but isn't a decodable image passes the loader's `isFile` check, so the pet shows in the picker but renders blank. Documented as a caveat; consider a cheap header sniff at load time if false-valid pets become a support issue.
